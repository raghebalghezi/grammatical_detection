Hi Mark, Thank you for your lovely letter which I received this morning. 	B1

It was the best decision I've ever made. It happened this summer. 	B1

 There's this flame of passion between them. 	C2

It's a story where there's this old man who makes a marionette that comes to life. 	C2

In our group there was this girl, tiny and fragile, very sensitive; she had a special way with words. 	C2

What is more, not only is this rare talent of theirs used for public pleasure but also for international sports success, which makes us all proud. 	C2

This characteristic of his is shown in every situation of his life. 	C2

I also told her that if I had been in her shoes, I would not have put up with that sort of behaviour. 	C2

All of my friends were there. 	A2

I bought some T-shirts and jeans, because some of my clothes are too small for me. 	A2

Bring some of your DVDs. 	A2

But after that I saw that I spent all of my money! 	A2

I spent a long time receiving presents, all of my family were here. 	A2

They were having the time of their lives, watching all the animals the zoo had, but when they returned to their car, they saw that someone was stealing Paul's suitcase. 	B1

They filmed the artists and their work. 	B1

I couldn't see their faces. 	B1

It was the biggest TV in the bazaar with its huge, black screen. 	B1

The journey was quite long but Verona is a great city, with its buildings and churches. 	B1

They've chosen my school because of its size. 	B1

Living in Greece, I have had a chance to realise how much tourism can affect one's life. 	C1

After one has spent enough time away from one 's parents and has a personality of one's own, it is definitely possible to move in with one's parents. 	C1

In my opinion, this process depends on one's ability to open another way of communicating apart from one's mother language. 	C1

However, I believe that in order to maintain its popularity, the programme should keep some of the series' aspects the same, but alter some others. 	C2

He started to shake me and meanwhile I heard a familiar voice; it was my father's. 	C2

We danced, played games and had lots of fun . 	A2

The new art class starts next Monday and each class is about 1 hour long. 	A2

Yesterday I bought three t-shirts: one blue t-shirt, one pink t-shirt and one yellow t-shirt. 	A2

We have an extra ticket and are wanting you to come. 	A2

But we didn't have much money, so we didn't buy many things. 	A2

I want to sell the television because I haven't got much time to watch it. 	A2

There aren't many tickets. 	A2

I bought them because I haven't got many winter clothes. 	A2

We played so many games, like dog and bone, four corners, and many more. 	A2

We visited so many places, mostly monuments. The weather was perfect. 	A2

I know, I bought too many things but I liked all of them. 	A2

I spent all of my money! 	A2

Some of my friends gave me books. 	A2

The competition was very tough because both of the teams were good. 	A2

Many of my relatives and friends had come. 	A2

I enjoyed the party. I had invited five of my friends and my family. 	A2

Without a library card you can't take any of the books with you. 	A2

So several days ago we received a complaint. 	B1

I took it and wished to have millions of dollars. 	B1

They interviewed a few of the students, the teachers and the headmistress. 	B1

I went with my friends so we could spend a little time together. 	B1

I had a bit of free time, so I took the bus and I went to my friend's house. 	B1

I just watch a little bit of TV when I come home from school. 	B1

I'm convinced that most people watch too much TV these days. 	B1

If you haven't got enough credit on your phone, we can meet at 11 am at the bookshop. 	B1

I think if we meet at 8 pm, we'll have plenty of time to buy the tickets and some drinks. 	B1

We went to loads of beautiful places. 	B1

How much television do you watch? 	B1

Do you watch much TV? 	B1

Hello Marina. Unfortunately I have so much work at the moment that I can't help you. 	B1

My neighbours are making too much noise. 	B1

Have you got many friends in England? 	B1

 How many channels are there in Britain? 	B1

In my opinion you should spend half of your holiday with your parents and the other half with your friends: I think this would be the best thing to do. 	B1

Anyway that's enough of my news! 	B1

Although I knew which kind of dress I wanted, none of the stores had it. 	B1

Because almost all of the programmes are stupid. 	B1

His name is Richard and since we were just little kids, we've spent nearly every day together. 	B1

I spend very little time outside, and I know I do not have enough stamina and strength. 	B2

We are sick of working hard for so little money. 	B2

There are so few animals living on the earth today and the pandas have so few places left to live and to eat, so we must try helping these animals. 	B2

Second, we would draw your attention to the fact that neither party could foresee or predict the recent rise in the price of wheat. 	C1

In the Czech Republic, somewhere between those two extremes, either way is possible. 	C1

This way, the toilet can be accessed easily from either floor. 	C1

Either of the measures is recommended and those measures are bound to enhance the company's competitive power. 	C1

Of course if you are not at all interested in sports, neither of these games will be of any interest to you. 	C1

However, you forgot to add that neither of us could foresee the rise in the price of wheat. 	C1

My kitchen is absolutely cramped. I love cooking and despite the fact that I have no space, I managed to fit in a table as well as millions of cookbooks and all the necessary kitchen tools. 	C1

I'm going to make loads of cookies this year and will give them in nice little boxes to my family and friends. 	C1

I received tons of plastic ducks every time I had my birthday or some kind of celebration. 	C1

Will they be holding any activities at night? 	B2

Will I be needing any money? 	B2

What will you be doing in a few years if now you don't even try to do anything? 	B2

Will I be needing any money? 	B2

As far as I'm concerned, we should definitely do some additional publicity, particularly for the new offerings which might be coming up. 	C1

For example, your boss may be calling at 10 pm asking you to prepare a report for next day's meeting. 	C1

You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! 	B2

When I was about to answer the question, I realised that it was not as easy as I had thought. 	B2

Dear Helen, Believe it or not, I was just about to write you a letter when I received yours. 	B2

Just as we were about to climb through the broken window, a policeman arrived on the scene. 	B2

Now I am staying in Hastings in England and this month, I will have been studying English for seven months. 	B2

I think I could have a holiday just in July because I will have been working for my company for one year by the end of the June. 	B2

I do not think that this aspect is really necessary because it is supposed that  you will have been studying very hard to occupy that job . 	C2

We were taken by surprise, when we didn’t get a tour guide. We ought to have booked one! 	C1

Secondly, supplier contracts shall not be omitted. 	C1

This is, as I mentioned in my letter, only in the event I shall not be able to pick you up at the airport. 	C1

We therefore need to insist that the agreement is binding and that the contract shall be fulfilled. 	C1

I have to inform you that if we do not receive a reply this time we shall take the matter to court. 	C2

You should have heard the noise. 	B1

You should have seen my face, I was so happy. 	B1

You should have been there with me, I had a great time. 	B1

Thank you for the present you sent me, you shouldn't have! 	B1

Thank you for the money, you shouldn't have sent it. 	B1

Well, have you ever checked your blood pressure? I think you should. 	B2

John spent the rest of the day thinking about what he should do. in fact, he wanted to answer and meet her again, but he knew that he shouldn't. 	B2

Well, you should be bouncing up and down with joy 	B2

These are the reasons that I believe we should be reading books instead of watching television in our free time and I believe many people believe the same thinks as I do. 	B2

The computer systems should be working again once you restart them. 	B2

However, I think that the situation should be improving in the next 6 months, especially during the third quarter of the year. 	B2

 The groom should be waiting at the entrance for the bride. 	C1

Wild animals should be running free but I think that zoos today have an important role in keeping them alive. 	B2

I used to share my room with my brother. 	B1

When I was a little girl, we used to be together all the time. 	B1

We didn't use to talk to each other. 	B1

But this year I've met lots of new people that I didn't used to talk to, like Monica and Nina. 	B1

When I was I child, I used to go to a small school and I enjoyed it very much. 	B1

and she used to come to my house and play computer games with me. 	B1

I didn't use to laugh much but since the day we met, I'm always happy. 	B1

She doesn't travel as much as she used to. 	B2

I must admit that they did sound quite a lot better than they used to. 	B2

I used to play until late in the evening, I used not to do my homework and I did not excel at school. 	C2

I'll come to see you tomorrow morning. 	A1

I will bring some music to the dinner. 	A1

I'll see you tomorrow. 	A1

If I need a camera, I will use my mobile phone. 	A2

And if my mum can, she will fetch you. 	A2

If you can help me, I will be very happy. 	A2

Don't worry, you won't need anything apart from some pencils and your art book. 	A2

I hope it will not be boring! 	A2

Will you be at home? 	A2

I'm happy because I'll see you tomorrow, but what time will you be here? 	A2

Will you come by bus? 	A2

Will you come with any friends? 	A2

My mother will get us there, and she will bring us to my house after too. 	A2

Will you come with me? 	A2

Will you be able to visit some museums with me? 	A2

Mr Miller, the Sales Director, will visit us next Thursday. 	B1

I'm sorry, but I won't be able to attend your class tomorrow . 	B1

I think that in 20 years' time it will be bigger than it is, because my town is growing very fast. 	B1

All your life, you'll be able to look at your parents, but as soon as you finish your school, it'll be harder to meet your old friends. 	B1

But you're right, without much sport practice you'll soon put on weight, won't you? 	B1

Will you please send me his name, address and telephone number. 	B2

Will you please inform me about the exact payment. 	B2

Will you pay attention! 	B2

The abundance of ingredients required in any recipe will result normally in a spicy but nutritious dish, a dish that will usually contain some kind of sauce made of hot pepper, tomatoes, garlic and onion, some kind of meat and also some vegetables. 	C1

She will often knock on the door to see you. 	C1

Go to lots of beautiful places that you won't usually be able to go to with a car, such as riversides. 	C1

Indeed no one can imagine what children will do! 	C2

I would like to eat some Spanish food. 	A1

I would like to invite you to dinner in my house on Saturday at 7 30 pm. 	A1

If possible, I'd like to come to see you on Tuesday afternoon. 	A1

I would like to eat chicken, potatoes and some vegetables. 	A1

I'd love to have a pen-friend in Japan. 	A2

 I would prefer Sunday afternoon. 	A2

 You wouldn't believe how much they cost! 	A2

I think we would not need much money. 	A2

Sarah, would you like to play tennis this evening? 	A2

I'm going to a concert on Saturday. Would you like to go with me? 	A2

I want to watch the film, would you like to come with me? 	A2

I was thinking of painting my bedroom blue. It would look awesome. 	A2

It would be fun there. 	A2

 It would be very good if you came with me. 	A2

It would be nice to bring your new computer game and some clothes. 	A2

It would be perfect if you arrived at 7.20. 	A2

I would prefer to go on Sunday, because on Sunday I have no school. 	A2

 I'd prefer to see it tomorrow. 	A2

Bring your new CD! I'd love to hear it! 	A2

It's your decision but if I had the chance, I would go with my friends. 	B1

If you decided to go to the country school, you'd probably have more attention as a student. 	B1

If I were you, I would not watch TV all the time. 	B1

If I were able to move, I wouldn't move because I think this street is perfect.  	B1

I did not think my friend Janis would have done that. 	B1

That answer would have changed my life. 	B1

Without your help, I wouldn't have got this result. 	B1

Had it not been for that day, she would not have met George. 	B1

Would you let me know what you think? 	B1

Would you please do me a favour? Could you go and collect the clothes for me? 	B1

Think of the fun you will have with your friends, the whole day hanging around, playing sports, eating ice cream. Wouldn't that be wonderful? 	B1

I think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it? 	B1

I hope you will come soon, and I think that you would really enjoy it because is something different of what you are used to. 	B1

More over in my opinion it would probably be the best idea to choose the biggest school ... 	B1

I would definitely choose to live by the sea side! 	B1

I've just bought a new dress, and a beautiful black T-shirt. When I saw them, I thought they would be great for tonight's party. 	B1

 we thought that the film would be horrible because of the title but when the film started, the story was beautiful and Mauricio and I liked it a lot. 	B1

And she asked me if I would play the game with her against her cousin and her friend on Saturday. 	B1

The next week I would have flown to Miami to meet George Clooney. 	B1

If I were in your shoes I would have chosen the school which is in the centre of town  	B1

If you hadn't helped me, I wouldn't have known how to do that homework project. 	B1

If I had gone with uncomfortable shoes, I wouldn't have danced all the time. 	B1

I'd advise you to go with your friends because I bet you'll have so much fun! 	B1

If you want my opinion, I'd recommend the countryside because I think that the city in my country is very noisy. 	B1

Finally, I'd say that you should talk with your parents and your friends to decide. 	B1

If you have decided to move, I would say that it is better for you to choose the large school in the centre of the town. 	B1

Would you tell me about your room in your next letter, please? 	B1

Would it be possible for you to meet me later that day, around 7? 	B1

I had forgotten I have an appointment with my dentist at that time, so, would you mind if we met at 5 o'clock instead of meeting at 4 o'clock? 	B1

We are supposed to have a barbecue for lunch, would you mind bringing a salad? 	B1

She accepted the invitation and she said that she would come on the 21st of June. 	B1

I felt better when he said that he would be in Fenerbahce. 	B1

He told me I would like it and he was right! 	B1

We had to leave without you because the bus driver wouldn't wait. 	B1

It was all that I wanted in life but my parents would not allow me to buy it. 	B1

In my opinion I worked very hard. I would spend a lot of hours at work. 	B2

At night they would go to the rocky seaside and light a fire in order to deceive the boats and let them crash on the rocks. 	B2

Considering the aspects of our education system, and the results of my research, I would strongly recommend the following changes to be made. 	C1

Because of her wide and excellent experience with small children I believe that Nascha would easily fit into a family with small children. 	C1

I believe that the construction of such a centre would undoubtedly contribute to the improvement of our quality of life. 	C2

Organising family-oriented activities would significantly increase membership and raise the society's popularity with the local community. 	C2

It is probably in the sitting room on the table. 	A2

You should probably wear a T-shirt and shorts, with sneakers. 	A2

 It's definitely going to get messy. 	A2

I think I left my phone there, maybe in your kitchen. 	A2

Maybe we could visit that park you told me about or play at your house. 	A2

I want to buy new trousers and, perhaps, a T-shirt. 	A2

There you can dance, eat, drink and meet new friends 	A2

Perhaps it's in the kitchen under the table. 	A2

If I were you I'd certainly choose not to go with your parents. 	B1

I will certainly ring you on Friday. 	B1

Well, with the job you’ve got, you obviously can't keep fit. 	B1

For these reasons, I definitely recommend staying in a city. 	B1

Next year you can surely go somewhere with your friends. 	B1

You should probably bring sun block, because it's going be hot, and some food of course. 	B1

In my opinion if you decided to go to a large school in the centre of town, you would certainly meet a lot of cool people and you'd probably find it great. 	B1

Could I possibly see you at 3.30? 	B1

Could you possibly recommend what action should be taken? 	B1

As a conclusion, I want to say that while what we wear doesn't necessarily define who we are, it does play a big part in it. 	C1

This is not necessarily the way the older generation would see it though. 	C1

Presents. Strips, bows, paper-wrapping. Thinking of Christmas? Not necessarily. 	C1

Do I agree with this statement? Definitely. 	C2

There is also a park near my house. 	A1

My husband is a teacher. 	A1

That's why I like this place. 	A1

I go to college every day. 	A1

Martin is my best friend. 	A1

We have a big garden and a small swimming pool. 	A1

Her favourite colours are blue and black. 	A1

I have new neighbours. 	A1

They're nice people. 	A1

This place has nice shops. 	A1

I like reading interesting books in the Library. 	A1

Every Friday I go swimming and play computer games. 	A1

I am having a dinner party on Friday 25 December at 7 pm. 	A1

Can you come to my house on Friday evening? 	A1

My girlfriend likes vegetable pasta with tomato sauce, because she is vegetarian. 	A1

The food was delicious and the music was great. 	A2

The weather was so cold. 	A2

I phoned for more information two days ago. 	A2

 It is very important because I need to do some homework in it. 	A2

There are so many shops, you can play games, eat food like Chinese food. 	A2

I had so much fun! 	A2

I spent too much money, five hundred euros, but I don’t mind because they are beautiful! 	A2

I visited a lot of museums and I went shopping. 	A2

All of our classmates were there and some of my cousins too. 	A2

I bought a beautiful pink skirt and a white top. 	A2

Lysiane is taller than me and she has short black hair. 	A2

It is a beautiful old city and there is the old wall around the city. 	A2

I left my small white bag. 	A2

 I'd forgotten that I have an appointment with the doctor  	B1

The ABC Company called this morning to say that our company had not delivered the goods on time. 	B1

I hadn't heard from her for two months. 	B1

It was the most beautiful one I had ever seen. 	B1

So, she came to America to see a relation she had never seen before, and she spent the money with me. 	B1

I had just arrived from school when I saw the letter. 	B1

I had always wanted to visit European cities and Paris was one of the easiest cities to get to from England. 	B1

He then thought how stupid he had been. 	B1

Actually I'd arranged an appointment with my doctor before calling you. 	B1

He was sleeping but I realised that this was because he had lost a lot of blood. 	B2

I was driving on to my parents' house because I had arranged to have dinner with them. 	B2

If only I had listened to my father! 	B2

If only I had met her before. 	B2

I am sure, because at the end of the concert, I said to my friend "I wish they had played a bit more". 	B2

I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. 	B2

I wish I hadn't done that but now I can't do anything. 	B2

Never had I been in such a ridiculous situation! 	B2

Never before had we seen such marvellous species of fish. 	B2

...but no sooner had I gone to bed than someone broke the door down. 	B2

But, no sooner had I got there than my classmates informed me that I had done well in my physics exam. 	B2

But now she felt stronger and had lost her fear. 	B2

Simon was a very famous writer and had written ten best-sellers. 	B2

All her friends from Chicago had come to visit her and had brought a huge chocolate cake with them. 	B2

They were cold and had gone numb. 	B2

Had I made the same mistake twice? 	B2

? the question was: Why had he done that? 	B1

He had finally achieved his goal! 	B2

She had suddenly woken up at that noise, but now was trying to persuade herself it was just a dream. 	B2

And had all the furniture and David's personal things been stolen by thieves or had they just simply disappeared? 	B2

After a while Mr and Mrs Landsbury, the couple who had organised the party, got everybody's attention and  asked everybody to stay calm. 	B2

He went to the hotel because he wanted to find out who the person was that had sent him a mysterious letter? 	B2

 it was Annika who had arranged a huge party for her, and all her friends and family, at the airport. 	B2

After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. 	B2

We had planned to go to Switzerland, but unfortunately our car broke down. 	B2

At first she had wanted to make the first move but she wasn't quite convinced. 	B2

I asked him who had given him my phone number and he said it had been me. 	B2

He didn't find her, in spite of looking for her in every room of her house, so he decided to come to my house to ask me if I had seen her somewhere. 	B2

I asked her what had happened and she told me that my grandmother was very ill. 	B2

 one morning she was listening to the radio, when suddenly the announcer said that the police had arrested a man who had stolen five expensive and unique paintings. 	B2

She tried to explain what had happened, but she couldn't. 	B2

I looked at the address and I knew what had happened to my sister's postcard. 	B2

Had I known the tour would be so bad, I wouldn't have booked it. 	C1

Had they been new people, travellers from other countries, I could have taken it, but all the customers were English! 	C1

Sometimes I think that had I gone to Britain without this experience, my life would have been different. 	C1

If only she had not changed, if only I had helped her, maybe we would still be best friends and I would not be sitting here, writing about her! 	C2

If only I hadn't been that rude! 	C2

Had it not been for the fact that I had already read the article, I would have thought that this woman was at least thirty years old. 	C2

Another aspect of his emotional side is the fact that he is a very private person, and had it not been for this feature, he might have been able to react differently. 	C2

If it hadn't been for my lack of knowledge, skills, experience, and some other things like that, I wouldn't have been fired. 	C2

They had become very good friends and their friendship could have gone a little further if it hadn't been for Dan's character. 	C2

Hardly had she spoken these words when it dawned on the musician that life could not continue like that. 	C2

Hardly had he taken them from the counter when the monster vanished again. 	C2

Every day at college I went to class at 9 am. 	A1

I met her about ten years ago. 	A1

My grandmother lived in a village and I often went there. 	A1

The people were very polite. 	A1

Every time I went to Hendon Park, I saw so many people there. 	A1

I liked this place very much. 	A1

I forgot to tell you some details about tomorrow evening. 	A2

I spent about £35 on all those clothes. 	A2

 I liked it very much because my favourite team won, it was great. 	A2

The player from China did not look very happy though. 	A2

You did not keep your promise. 	A2

I didn't tell you that my house is opposite the new cinema. 	A2

They didn't cost much ... 	A2

I was surprised because the heating didn't work. 	A2

Did you buy something yesterday? 	A2

 Did you find it? 	A2

And when did you go shopping last? 	A2

When I arrived, the weather was horrible. 	A2

 I think I left it in the kitchen when I fell on the slippery floor. 	A2

I convinced some of my friends to come with me even if they don't like rap music. 	B1

Previously I faced many failures but I never gave up. 	B1

The cameraman filmed us during a lesson and later, walking to the playground. 	B1

I didn't realise I had lost the ring till I was at home. 	B1

I didn't trust him. 	B1

we had one in the garage that we did not use. 	B1

Did you receive my present? 	B1

How did you spend your weekend? 	B1

Why didn't he call me? 	B1

We arranged to meet each other next Tuesday at 11 o'clock, didn't we? 	B1

Didn't you spend your last holiday with them as well? 	B1

he always seemed so confident to me! 	B1

we always talked during the class. 	B1

It would be better if you spent some time in the fresh air with your friends or walking in a park. 	B1

If you wanted to do some outdoor activities, we could go fishing or even walking through the green fields.	B1

I remember her as a shy girl, but I read she became a manager, she went on lots of trips, she met a lot of new friends, she got married and then she got divorced. 	B1

We met at 9 in the morning and decided to go to the seven lakes, a very wonderful place not far from the centre of the town: lots of trees, lots of flowers and very fresh air. 	B1

We waited for the suitcase for two days and then we bought new dresses. 	B1

I wish that you were here, cycling with us. 	B1

I wish you were here with me. I wish we were together. 	B1

I wish weekends lasted five days. 	B1

I didn't hesitate and went there straight away. 	B2

I'm sure it wasn't my fault as I didn't switch anything on or off at that moment. 	B2

? we really enjoyed our holiday even though things did not turn out they way we planned. 	B2

Are you still looking for a job or did you succeed in finding one? 	B2

When did you last see your wife and your children? 	B2

It was great to have met you, and we certainly had a terrific time together, didn't we? 	B2

Didn't you tell me that you had to go to Orleans today? 	B2

Why didn't you say something about it? 	B2

as soon as we went down to around 15 metres in depth, we saw a lot of coloured fish. 	B2

I told you about that terrible hotel I had stayed in before I came to visit you. 	B2

Once he got inside, he started searching for some clues to that horrible crime. 	B2

I also worked as a helper on a summer camp for primary schoolchildren in Canada last summer. 	B2

I can remember one which happened to me last year, during the Christmas holiday. 	B2

He worked hard for quite a long time to earn the money he needed. 	B2

I think it would be very helpful if I told you my own case. 	B2

It would be great if you sent me a free copy of the next edition of The Student Tourist Guidebook. 	B2

I would be grateful if you gave me this job. 	B2

So, I wondered if you could introduce me to somebody who knows how to use a camera, so that I will be able to record my trip for you. 	B2

I wanted to know if the rooms are single or double, if they have showers and if there is room service. B2 Secondly, I also wanted to know if there is a gym in the hotel ?  	B2

First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. 	B2

The companies I found at the trade fair were very varied. Not only did I find high-technology companies, but also shoemakers, advertisement companies and plane manufacturers to name but a few. 	C1

Not only didn't we travel 5000 miles in 30 days, as you had advertised, but also we stayed 8 days in just one place, which had nothing interesting to see except a church. 	C1

Not only didn't I learn any new grammar but also I couldn't enrich my vocabulary. 	C1

Did you spot the fact that what is expected from us in Tall Trees Campsite is to help in organising the entertainment? 	C1

How did it turn out then? 	C1

I told you about Peter and Mary, didn't I? 	C1

Didn't we all dream of being famous once in our lives? 	C1

Following advice from a friend, I purchased the English version of your product, only to find out its quality did not match the promises made in your advertisement. 	C1

After having discussed this subject with the other member, we came up with the following decisions. First of all ?  	C1

We did reach the target figure and we have sent about 85 percent of the money to the hospital. 	C1

 We did have 34 games and one stall with beverages and snacks. 	C1

It is true that it did rain during the day but it was not a "sudden downpour",  as you wrote. It was more a small shower ?  	C1

I understand you are quite concerned about the matter and I thought it would be a good idea to let you know what is really going on. 	C1

The reason why I'm writing to you is that I thought you might be interested in writing about a special dish from your country for the international cookbook. 	C1

I have been thinking about your letter. 	B1

We've been studying together since grade one. 	B1

The letter was from my brother, who has been living in New York since he graduated from university. 	B1

Have you been thinking about it a lot?! 	B1

What have you been doing? 	B1

 ? how long have you been playing them? 	B1

I've been watching TV a lot, specially the sports programmes. 	B1

I have been playing my new game. 	B1

Last week I went out with my cousin Jim and his wife; he told me he had joined a sport club and he has been going there for two weeks; 	B1

Susan has been working in our company for 6 years as a Sales Representative. 	B2

I hope that I have not been wasting your time and giving you too much trouble. 	B2

Hope you haven't been working too hard! 	B2

The heating system has not been working properly since your staff completed the work in my house. 	B2

I have just been reading an article in your newspaper this morning, about The Westfield Music Festival. 	B2

I've also been singing in a choir for five years, so I'm very familiar with it. 	B2

You have already been complaining about headaches and insomia. 	B2

They might be slippery when it has been snowing. 	B2

Not only have I been wandering its streets ever since I was ten, but I have also come to know most of the main characters of its history in the past 50 years. 	C1

Not only have I been expecting it for the last few months but I will also give some support to my wife, who has been feeling a little nervous these last weeks. 	C2

I haven't eaten Italian food for a long time. 	A2

I'm sorry I haven't written for so long. 	A2

 I haven't seen it yet . 	A2

 It's very important because I haven't finished it yet. 	A2

I like Japanese people and I've been to Japan more than three times. 	A2

We have seen the Tower of London, Big Ben, the Houses of the Parliament and of course Buckingham Palace. 	A2

I haven't eaten Italian food for a long time. 	A2

I haven't seen you for a long time. 	A2

Have you bought anything? 	A2

Hi Jools, How have you been? 	A2

Where have you been? 	A2

I have never seen a competition like that before, and I love it. 	A2

I have just seen your notice. 	A2

I've seen the British Museum. 	A2

We have visited the Coliseum and several museums. 	A2

After the film, we should go to "The Golden Pagoda" because I've never been there. 	A2

You know I haven't been to France before. 	A2

I have been here since August 2006. 	B1

It's been a long time since we went out together so I think we will have a great time at the park playing sports and chatting! 	B1

Many things have changed since your last visit. 	B1

Such a long time has passed since the last time we met. 	B1

She is from California, but she has just moved to Italy. 	B1

Our company has signed deals with a few German companies. 	B1

He hasn't spoken to anyone from that time till now. 	B1

She is a quiet person so she has not made a lot of friends. 	B1

We haven't decided where to go yet, but probably it will be to somewhere like Australia or New Zealand. 	B1

Haven't you seen it yet? 	B1

Haven't your parents given you their advice? 	B1

I still haven't read the role but when I read it, I was very excited and I accepted Mr Brown's offer. 	B2

You asked me whether I bought a computer or a bicycle and I have to tell you that I still haven't decided. 	B2

How has your family been? 	B2


But what have these animals done? 	B2

In 1970 people in the UK married in their early 20s, but nowadays they marry at the end of their 20s. But why has this changed? 	B2

Thus, you have not fulfilled your task with due care, as you have stated in your letter. 	C1

Somehow, in my country education has not evolved, although it manages to maintain some advantages. 	C1

A new shopping centre has opened in our town. 	C2

I think Bremen won't change that much within the next 20 years. 	B1

I hate shopping via the internet. 	B1

The company chose my school thanks to the excellent results of the students. 	B1

It was saying that some company can find me a job in the UK and I can earn up to £ 1000 per month. 	B1

 I was going out of the shop when I noticed that I had lost it. 	B1

I would like to apologise because, due to a dental appointment, I will not be able to participate in the English class tomorrow. 	B1

The best place to stay is a hotel a bit outside of the city. 	B1

It's quite near my house so I can go there easily. 	B1

When I was trying to reach the only frame of light I could see in the woods, something moved right behind me. 	B1

I'm going to put it right in front of the window, so I have enough light. 	B1

I felt I was flying and it was really like a dream. 	B1

But anyway it's enjoyable to shop for clothes  especially with a group of friends. 	B1

So this is the best festival I been to. 	B1

Please give him all the information he asks for. 	B1

Everybody should see which company I work for. 	B1

She did not say very much except for "oh" and "yes, yes" every once in a while. 	B2

 And it gives them the possibility of gradually gaining knowledge about other living creatures apart from humans. 	B2

 It is based on my personal opinions in addition to a sample of 500 people who are students and staff at the school, and also visitors. 	B2

Now, as for the camping, I admit that I'm not a great fan of it. 	B2

I hope that, in spite of some small problems, people liked the festival and we will be able to attend it next year. 	B2

According to your advertisement in a language magazine, you have a vacancy in which I am very interested. 	B2

I hope that you can help me by answering some questions about the club of which you are the secretary. 	B2

In my opinion children need someone to whom they can talk. 	B2

Suddenly the lights went out and a kind of silent screaming was heard throughout the whole dark room. 	B2

I bought a pullover and trousers because mine are too small for me. 	A2

The phone is not mine. 	A2

You should bring your computer games and Maths book. I have lost mine. 	A2

I want to give you a birthday present like mine. 	A2

It was my best present, although I also loved yours. 	A2

My favourite meal is spaghetti with garlic bread. What's yours? 	A2

To go to my house from yours, take the first on the right, Victoria Road, and there is an underground station. 	A2

I bought a pink mobile. It's like yours. 	A2

So that's all about my mobile phone. Please write to me about yours too! 	A2

Maybe you can take a friend of yours with you there. 	B1

I think that it's a very good idea of yours to come to the UK.	B1

You can ask some friends of yours to join you. 	B1

Hope you have a friend as good as mine! 	B1

My bedroom is not as big as yours but it is lovely. 	B1

My town isn't very big, so I think it won't grow as fast as yours. 	B1

I hope  my English becomes as good as yours. 	B1

We bought it because yours is very old and sometimes stops working. 	B1

I really needed some extra information, and yours was very useful. 	B1

Finally we went to Venice where we met some friends of ours and spent with them the rest of the holiday. 	B2

The credit crunch is heavily affecting this region, therefore all retail sales have fallen and many competitors of ours are decreasing their sales too. 	B2

Paul, a classmate of ours, will be the D.J. and we are thinking of listening to rock music, since Mr. Brown likes it. 	B2

I told my mother that your Spanish omelette is better than hers. 	B2

Lots of changes which may occur during the next fifty years can make us fear that our sons' and grandsons' lives will not be as happy as ours. 	B2

At the entrance, the security guard asked for my identity card. Pat gave hers. 	B2

She didn't remember leaving it there, it wasn't even hers, which is what frightened her the most. 	B2

But when she gave this suitcase a good look, she realised that it wasn't hers. 	B2

She saw him on a train running parallel to hers. 	B2

Can we rent windsurf boards or should we bring ours with us? 	B2

 ? when we read about them we think that we are the characters and we live their stories as if they were ours. 	B2

Aldous Huxley was able to create a new world which is not so different from ours. 	B2

 This road shouldn't be allowed in the middle of a small town like ours. 	B2

Ours is the only store in this locality which opens at 7.00 am. 	B2

Ours is a retail company with 5 outlets, dealing in furnishings. 	B2

In order to persuade them, we would like to show comparisons between our products and the ones from other companies to demonstrate that ours are more effective and efficient. 	B2

I could show them the traditional things of our country and learn theirs. 	B2

She told him that this baby was theirs. 	B2

Red Stone are a very big group, you know that I'm a great fan of theirs. 	B2

I realise that it can be a very interesting experience and I can also improve my foreign language as well as theirs. 	B2

I hope that other councils will consider improving the cyclists' cycling conditions as ours did. 	C1

Yes, of course there are much larger gardens in this area, but ours is more than four times as big as the one we had in Holland. 	C1

What is more, the manager organises excursions to London. Ours was breathtaking. We visited unbelievably interesting museums? 	C1

I could just imagine it, meeting her at her house, her mother asking me to take care of her between puffs of smoke and coughing fits in that hoarse voice of hers. 	C2

I kept silent when I was introduced to that new girlfriend of his. 	C2

You can park that precious jeep of yours. 	C2

I've been looking all over for that bright great-nephew of mine. 	C2

I put Sophie's pictures in my bag because hers was already packed. 	C2

 I also recall my father saying to my mother that hers was not as good as my grandmother's. 	C1

She thought, as she sometimes did, that hers was a drab existence, but that she could do hardly anything to avoid it. 	C2

Therefore, his was not a happy and normal childhood. 	C2

He was my confidant and I was his. 	C2

It was as if she had completely forgotten about the outlines of his face, his hair, all the features that were his. 	C2

Bob attracts many of his students to the teaching career, which is rather looked down on in a developing poor country like his. 	C2

I was a great admirer of hers. 	C2

She asked some old friends of hers and she went to the church where the marriage was taking place. 	C2

My parents invited the father of a friend of theirs who spoke French. 	C2

Then he showed me a very old diary of his, just for me to have an idea of what to do. 	C2

He was able to build a very successful business which allowed him and his family to live very well and to travel 	C2

Theirs is a relationship between two members of the privileged classes, who really don't care about the world around 	C2

Theirs had always been a love-and-hate relationship. 	C2

Yet, beautiful dreams never last long, and theirs lasted until she had to leave England. 	C2

When comparing the value and achievements of athletes with doctors or scientists, theirs begin to lack in significance. 	C2

I enjoyed myself so much. 	A2

I bought myself a yellow T-shirt with nothing on it. 	A2

I hope you'll enjoy yourself . 	A2

I will ask my friends from the class and I will study by myself. 	B1

You can do some exercise by yourself. 	B1

He tried to open it by himself. 	B1

She decided to find him by herself. 	B1

I decided to talk to him and introduce myself. 	B1

First you should ask yourself if you have enough money for the journey. 	B1

Lisa told herself to be strong and hoped everything would be alright. 	B1

I was really surprised when I read the e-mail. It was from someone who calls himself  the black shadow. 	B1

He told me about himself and how he started playing the guitar. 	B1

Now she was very proud of herself. 	B1

The best solution will be if you decide yourself what to do. 	B1

I think it was the director himself who guided the actress through our wonderful school gardens to film the opening scene there. 	B1

The food was delicious, especially the cake, which Sandra had cooked herself. 	B1

A friend of mine and I are planning to spend a short holiday by ourselves. 	B2

There are many things to say, but I think that you will find these by yourselves. 	B2

Then suddenly, the lights started clicking on and off, the windows opened by themselves. 	B2

If an animal is kept by itself , with no one to keep it company, it will get lonely and very sad. 	B2

Suddenly, the window opened by itself and the room filled with cold air. 	B2

Doing sports is an excellent way to relax and it can help us to feel good about ourselves. 	B2

The staff didn't have enough time for themselves. 	B2

In this way we will be able to enjoy ourselves even if this is not well-paid work. 	B2

In the afternoons, you'll be able to visit the archaeological sites and in the evening you can entertain yourselves by dancing or listening to music in our city clubs. 	B2

But adults often ask themselves the question - isn't it cruel to keep animals in zoos? 	B2

I would also spend much more quality time with my family as a whole, which is quite important in itself. 	B2

The architecture in itself is beautiful, but the garden is very wonderful, too. 	B2

To begin with, a car, in my opinion, can't be harmful in itself. The trouble is that, nowadays, very fast cars are put on the market and we never know if they are going to be driven by wise people or, instead, by crazy or dreadful drivers. 	B2

In my opinion, the main characters do not have to be liked by readers but the story itself must be good and interesting to be successful. 	B2

The building itself looks splendid and beautiful. 	B2

The food is not very good, but sometimes we can prepare something to eat ourselves. 	B2

They patiently explained to me my job even though they were fairly busy themselves. 	B2

Cars themselves are never dangerous. It depends on us, actually. 	B2

Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you in response to the advertisement published by yourselves in "the Traveller" regarding The Trip of a Lifetime. 	B2

The question you asked droves me back to my early life. My childhood. Like yourselves I am also living in a busy town, in a busy street. But when I was a little kid I was with my grand parents in Kandy. 	B1

Also, it is a great opportunity to improve my sailing skills as training will be provided by yourselves. 	B2

As for myself, as you can clearly see from my account of this musical event, music still means an awful lot to me, and most probably allways will. 	C2

 As for myself I like taking responsibilities. 	C2

 As for myself, I grew up during the "internet era", the years when it was spreading to average peoples homes and therefore I can still remember life without it. 	C2

The maths is boring and I don't like it. 	A1

If you can't find it, call me. 	A1

Do you like it too? 	A1

I'm very happy that you want to see me. 	A1

I can see her on Saturday at 8 pm. 	A1

It protects us from rain, wind and sun. 	A1

You will find a lot of different shops ? I hope you'll like them. 	A1

I really like to learn new words. It's very important for me. 	A1

Sometimes I go with her. 	A1

Can you bring some music so we can listen to it. 	A1

I spend my free time with them. 	A1

Hello Mrs Bishop. It's Clarisse 	A1

Dear Cris, it's me, Paarth. 	A2

Can I help you? 	A1

What do you think about that? 	A1

Can we have a chat? 	A1

Hi, Mrs. Bishop. How are you? 	A1

Is it OK? 	A1

In my free time I go shopping and I like swimming. 	A1

If you want, you can go inside. 	A1

He prefers chess. 	A1

My friend's name is Julissa, she is from Ecuador and she lives near my home. 	A1

I like my home because it is a beautiful home. It has a big garden and a good sitting room. 	A1

I like my front garden because it's very nice and warm. 	A1

They're nice people. 	A1

Hope to see you soon. 	A2

Hi! How are you? Hope you are fine. 	A2

It's warm and windy. 	A2

Now it 's 3 pm. 	B1

It is best to spend your time in the countryside. 	B1

It's boring to be at home when you have a lot of free time. 	B1

It's normal that your parents want you to go with them. 	B1

This shyness makes it hard for me to speak in public, or even to go out with my friends as often as I should. 	B2

Other retail companies with cheaper prices and lots of discounts make it impossible for us to do business. 	B2

Must rush now because I have to go out with Paul. 	B2

Sounds great. 	B2

Got to go now. 	B2

Can't wait to hear about your exam. 	B2
When you watch a film, it seems to be that you are inside it, and you are a character in it. 	B2

your company has carried out a full investigation on the matter and it appears that the disappearance was not the result of criminal activity. 	B2

It appears that there was an error with the older computer system. 	B2

If one doesn't live close enough to walk to work, one can choose to get there by bicycle or by car. 	B2

It was considered to be the most important thing to supply every computer with Internet and E-mail access 	C1

It is hoped that this report will help the club to improve and meet the needs of the whole school. 	C1

Firstly it was highlighted that so many people take advantage of the park, but our survey clearly contradicts this view. 	C1

It was my father who took all this away from me. 	C2

This is a very interesting place. 	A2

I'm very happy about this. 	A2

This is my number: 0754 567 78 51. 	A2

This is the information about the new art class: the class is on Fridays, and it starts at 4 pm and finishes at 6 pm. 	A2

Thank you for this. 	A2

I went shopping yesterday at Yalerias;. I bought three green T-shirts, a pair of sneakers and some socks. You might ask, why did I buy all this? 	A2

This is the best holiday I have ever had! 	A2

This is just a short note to ask you if you want to go with me to the ReggaRton's concert. 	A2

That was amazing. 	A2

After that, we can go and drink a cup of coffee and eat a piece of cake. 	A2

You know that blue is my favourite colour, so we are going to use that. 	A2

It has got a camera, and I like that. 	A2

They look really nice on me, that's why I bought them. 	A2

Please try to come after 4.30 because I won't be there before that. 	A2

That's great! 	A2

That's a pity! 	A2

That's a good idea! 	A2

That's all for now. 	A2

Well I think that's all. 	A2

To stay fit I'm eating lots of fruit and vegetables, but meat and fish, too. I think you should do this, too, if you haven't done it in the past. 	B1

People usually don't care about the cost. Because of this, weddings are more amazing. 	B1

My room seems to be very cold and very unfriendly. I think flowers and pictures change this. 	B1

Our department currently has a lot of work to do, because there are so many conferences to arrange, and it needs a person to be in charge of this. 	B1

These are the most important years for us as teenagers, and they have to be the best years! 	B1

These are the main things that I can tell you. 	B1

There are a few interesting and funny programmes like The Simpsons, Password or José Mota's hour. These are the only programmes I like watching. 	B1

I think that we have similar taste about things like these. 	B1

Most of my clothes are lemon, green or orange, those are my favourite colours! 	B1

Well, those are my ideas but you are the ones that are coming, and maybe you don't like the countryside. 	B1

Those are the things I like the most about her. 	B1

I don't really think I'd move, but if I had to, I would love to live in a city like Paris or Rome. I'm very keen on cities like those. 	B1

If you can't, you must choose one of these. 	B1

And we have to go to Sydney to see all of that. 	B1

There are a lot of programmes in my country, but only some of these are interesting. 	B1

I don't usually wear dresses but I had to buy this one because I am going to be in a singing competition. 	B1

 I have chosen that one because of my father and brother, they also like it. 	B1

This is only the beginning; there are a lot of things that should be done, but let's just start with these ones. 	B2

I have got several of those ones. 	B2

Moreover, for those who are not interested in sports and who prefer shopping, it would be a good idea to prevent cars and especially lorries from running in the center of the town. 	B2

In my opinion students should be forced to study all of the subjects, not only those which are enjoyable. 	B2

  Those that can be rebuilt wouldn't be demolished. 	B2

The opening hours of the store came in for a lot of praise, with 87% of those surveyed ranking it as good. 	B2

All those attending are requested to be on time. 	B2

It is widely known that the Russian educational system differs dramatically from that of the European, Asian or American countries. 	C1

Bring some good CDs. I don't have any. 	A2

 Did you take any? 	A2

There are a lot of functions but I don't know how to use all of them. 	A2

My uncle took all of us to the Eiffel Tower. 	A2

I've booked two tickets for both of us, so I hope you'll come. 	A2

The tickets cost £5 but I can pay for both of them. 	A2

 Both are going to keep you fit. 	B1

Both are very good films. 	B1

About going to the city or to the countryside, I think you'll enjoy both. 	B1

I am happy to select a few. 	B1

Well, in my country there are lots of programmes but only a few are interesting. 	B1

Moving from an area to another is not very simple, but there isn't a problem without a solution. 	B1

Of course some of them are closer than others but I love them all. 	B1

I have shot many photos with my new digital camera and I will send some of them by e-mail for you. 	B1

Children my age are playing too long with their computers.... But only a few of them. 	B1

So travelling is not at all a problem for any of us. 	B1

Please ensure each of them has a computer, and they can practise for at least half an hour after class. 	B1

As you could guess, each has a very unique style. 	B2

I would like to enquire if there will be one group or several depending on level of students? 	B2

Considering my abilities, there are several that I think you should consider. 	B2

Comparing the two firms, both of them go some way towards fulfilling our needs, but neither covers all. 	B2

 They are very clean and there are enough so you don't have to wait. 	B2

Neither of us could forsee any possible rise or fall in the price of wheat. 	B2

How about spending the last couple of days doing some activities like skiing, horse riding and rafting. If you are interested in either of them, have a go. 	B2

In recent years, the Internet, which used to be a luxury only used by the very few who had access to it, has become a means of exchanging information. 	C1

Sure, some of the motorists changed to bicycles or to public transport - but far too few. 	C1

Today we continue this tradition by organising lectures and exhibitions, generally open to the public, many of which deal with Hamburg-specific issues. 	C1

A lot has changed since prehistoric times. 	C2

A lot depends on your background. 	C2

Much has been said about the need for nuclear weapons, although after the end of USSR and consequently the end of the cold war, this topic was almost forgotten. 	C2

Much has been said about quality time, but children don't understand this concept, they only know whether you are there or you are not. 	C2

Many are the causes which have led us to a better and longer life. 	C2

Many are the examples of children who hate reading as they believe that it is pointless, but they are not able to judge from a young age. 	C2

My pillows are getting old and I need new ones. 	B1

To tell the truth, I prefer large schools to small ones. 	B1

We also need new armchairs, because a lot of the old ones are broken. 	B1

We should buy some new copiers and some new faxes because the old ones are very slow, and one copier is already broken. 	B1

I have seen many programs recently, but the ones that I liked best are the funny ones, and the science-fiction ones, because I like things that are unreal. 	B1

I also like watching films on Friday nights, there are some good ones on the first channel. 	B1

I've bought five new t-shirts, because I don't like my old ones anymore. 	B1

Weddings in our country? Well, they're pretty different from the ones in England. 	B1

Evil people, like the ones who did this, should die, or at least go to prison. 	B1

The products we received were not exactly the ones we ordered. 	B1

Our computers are out-dated and slow. I think we should replace them with new ones. 	B1

We all know that being a writer is difficult; either we know how to write or we don't. 	B2

Some of us find it very useful, whereas others still have difficulty in accepting technology as a valuable thing for everyone. 	B2

 Zoos give us different opportunities to do that and so to understand nature. 	B2

If a student wants to make music there is no point teaching them science, but to be a good musician I think general knowledge is important as well . 	B2

If a child had free time, he/she would play on his/her own and not with other children. 	B2

Furthermore, if somebody wants to be a journalist, he or she has to have an enormous knowledge of the world and people, because sometimes they must act like psychologists in order to obtain pieces of information. 	B2

He said the coach is really nice and that the first players get on well with each other. 	B1

We didn't use to talk to each other, but one day we started to talk and I discovered she was extremely friendly and nice. 	B1

I also thought to create a studying space where students, staff and visitors can meet one another. 	B2

Since we last saw one another many things have happened, but I must admit I have never enjoyed myself again the way I did when I was with you. 	B2

Perhaps it will help me understand what my two dogs say to one another. 	B2

Each person could be a help to the other. 	C1

They all seem to mean exactly the same but if you study them more carefully, you realize that each of them differs from the others in tiny details that can be relevant. 	C1

Generally speaking, each individual is different from the others. 	C1

Each of them admires the other's intelligence. 	C2

As regards other aspects of my upbringing my parents taught me the importance of having all the family together, each one helping the others, each one loving the others. 	C2

Can you bring some food or drinks for the dinner? 	A2

Is it cheap or expensive for you? 	A2

We can chat or watch a film. 	A2

Is this area in the city or in the countryside? 	B1

Do you feel more sympathy for your friends or your parents? 	B1

Shall we buy him a book, a CD or something else? 	B2

Poetry, history or something else? 	B2

Are you still with him or did you two break up? 	B1

Should I go there and talk to her or should I stay here? 	B1

What do you think about going for walks or jogging in your breaks? 	B1

For a few seconds he was quiet. I couldn't wait, I asked nervously about his exam, did he pass or not? 	B1

Do you want to do that or not? 	B1

Do you agree with me or not? 	B1

Will you be there till that time or not? 	B1

Is this new industry a blessing for the region or the exact opposite? 	C1

Maybe you could hand out toys or show a movie? 	C1

Maybe you will be able to arrange another excursion this year or provide more time there? 	C1

Do you enjoy reading, find it a waste of time or have an indifferent attitude to it? 	C2

Is he going to give it back to me or show it to everybody? 	C2

You don't know where I live, do you? 	A2

It differs from the story which you told me, doesn't it? 	A2

It's fantastic, isn't it? 	A2

It cost £30, it was not too expensive, was it? 	A2

I mean, your parents don't like discos, do they? 	B1

Doesn't sound interesting, does it? 	B1

He is not important, is he? 	B1

That isn't normal, is it? 	B1

You haven't been to my house before, have you? 	B1

We haven't met each other for about 1 year, have we? 	B1

And so you're moving to a different area, aren't you? 	B1

You love books, don't you? 	B1

It sounds peaceful, doesn't it? 	B1

We've arranged to meet at 12, haven't we? 	B1

I think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it? 	B1

When you come back, we should rent some movies, shouldn't we? 	B1

You'll see the programme on the 23rd of August, won't you? 	B1

We could go on holiday together, couldn't we? 	B1

Your boyfriend is also 16, is he? 	B1

You bought new black clothes, did you? 	B1

You are 14 years old, right? 	B1

I think you asked if I liked shopping for clothes, right? 	B1

You asked me for some help, right? 	B1

They're black, right? 	B1

Think about it, will you? 	B2

Go to the Lake Frene route, will you? 	B2

Let's check together, shall we? 	B2

As you put it that way, there isn't much of a difference with our time, is there? 	C1

But there is always something you can improve, isn't there? 	C1

How was your dinner yesterday? 	A2

How are you, my friend? 	A2

Where are you, men? 	A2

What do you think? 	A2

What did you do yesterday? 	A2

Where did you go? 	A2

How do you know? 	A2

Why don't you buy it? 	A2

How have you been? 	A2

What have you brought for me? 	A2

Who are you going with? 	A2

When are you coming here? 	A2

Where are you going? 	A2

What will you bring? 	A2

What can I do? 	A2

How can I help you? 	A2

How will you get here? 	A2

When can I visit you? 	A2

When can we meet? 	A2

Why don't we watch a film? 	A2

Why don't you come with me? 	A2

Why can't you do both things? 	B1

Why couldn't I control myself? 	B1

You still have this agonising headache. Why don't you go to your doctor? 	B2

Why didn't you check with the ticket office first before you wrote your article? 	B2

Why didn't you say something about it? 	B2

Why haven't you told me before? 	B2

Nevertheless, we still give presents because we really want to. You can recognize them normally very fast! They are the ones which are unexpected and made with lots of love. So what makes a good present? From my point of view, the best presents are personal and fitted to the individual. 	C1

The other very serious problem in connection with cars is pollution, which is the cause of more diseases and problems than we realise at the moment. But what are the alternatives? Berlin has a well-structured and functioning subway? 	C1

Some of them are coin operated but some are magnetic-card operated. Use these coin-operated ones because to call from the other ones, you should buy a magnetic card, which is only possible in post offices. What else can I tell you? If you want anything to drink or to eat after your arrival, there are restaurants at the airport. 	C1

Can you come to dinner in my house? 	A1

I can't find my CD, can you bring some music please? 	A1

Are you ok? 	A2

Where is your dog? Is it ok? 	A2

Are you ready? 	A2

Could you meet me at my home at 7 pm? 	A2

Could you look for it? 	A2

Would you like to go with me to the U2 concert? 	A2

Will you come with me? 	A2

My favourite song is 'Viva la vida'. Do you know it? 	A2

My bedroom will be blue!! I love this colour!! Do you like it? 	A2

Yesterday, I went to buy some new clothes at the new store that is opposite my house, do you remember it? 	A2

Did you see the football match last night? 	A2

Are you going to come? 	A2

Are you feeling better? 	A2

Are you going to the new art class? 	A2

Are you doing anything on Friday? 	A2

I've just watched a football competition with my family and friends. Have you watched it? 	A2

I left my mobile in your house, have you seen it? 	A2

Aren't you excited about it? 	B1

Isn't he sweet? 	B1

 Isn't it in the mountains? 	B1

Don't you think so? 	B1

Don't you like any programmes? 	B1

Don't you think she would be happy? 	B1

Don't you know me? 	B1

Haven't you seen it yet? 	B1

Haven't they got their own style? 	B1

Wouldn't you like to come? 	B1

I'm going to a picnic next Saturday with my parents, won't you come with us? 	B1

Can't you make both? 	B1

Finally two days ago I found it in my pocket! It's funny! Don't you think? 	B1

They're filming a part of Harry Potter at our school, because our main building is very old. Isn't that great? 	B1

You can even just relax and sunbathe while you drink a nice, cold lemonade. Wouldn't that be amazing? 	B1

While we were there, there was also a concert and I got to see Rihanna and Chris Brown! Isn't that awesome? 	B1

Do we not want our children to be as happy as possible? 	C2

Is it not too easy to put the blame systematically on our education? 	C2

Is it not possible to have this, though maybe on a smaller scale, in our everyday living right where we spend the majority of our time on earth? 	C2

Are they not aware of the negative effects the use of cars has on cities? 	C2

Can it not, sometimes, be harmful to the world? 	C2

I'm looking forward to seeing you! 	A2

I look forward to hearing from you. 	A2

I am looking forward to our meeting. 	A2

I could catch up with the work I miss after school from 3 to 4. 	B1

They interviewed and filmed pupils and teachers to find out how they get on with each other. 	B1

I'd better stop now and get on with my studying. 	B1

I think that if you want to have a peaceful holiday, you should get away from the city and enjoy the countryside, enjoy nature. 	B1

So you had better go walking or join a club, but don't forget to keep away from junk food. 	B1

I can look up to someone in admiration if he 	B2

Other people will see you as a knowledgeable person and they will look up to you. 	B2

You should face up to the problem and tell everybody the truth, that you are working too hard. 	B2

We couldn't just swim and eat ice-cream every day of our summer vacation, so we sat down and came up with the craziest idea ever. 	B2

Anyway, let me tell you what ideas I came up with. 	C1

Sometimes in order to feel confident and to be inspired we need a person to look up to. 	C1

This you will have to look out for. 	C1

This shows her superficiality, which Kingshaw cannot put up with. 	C2

Firstly, let me express that the situation you describe is certainly not something my client could easily put up with. 	C1

It is widely accepted that being a loyal and trusted individual means that the people around us can trust us or let us in on a secret. 	C2

I listen to music in the living room, and also eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. 	A1

I can look after her if she needs to do shopping and cleaning. 	A1

I like to walk in the woods and look for mushrooms. 	A1

If you need more information, please look at the information sheet at the entrance. 	B1

In fact, our company needs to train some staff on how to deal with the complaints of customers. 	B1

In Poland rules that refer to how to dress at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. 	B2

But there is one difficulty which we should deal with. 	B2

I would like to give you some ideas of what people in my community want to listen to. 	B2

I am really willing to know more about horses and to learn how to deal properly with them. 	B2

I hope you will look carefully at the enclosed papers and I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. 	B2

I hope that you'll come. 	A2

I think that it begins on 20 or 21 May. 	A2

My mother said that she can help us. 	A2

I heard that you are quite busy right now. 	A2

I hope you can go, buddy. 	A2

I think I left my phone there, maybe in your kitchen. 	A2

I think you should go visit the Kuala Lumpur Twin Towers. 	A2

I know it's impossible for you to come during examination time. 	A2

My mother said you can come to me at 6.30 pm. 	A2

I told you that she has a new car? 	A2

You promised me that you will help me to paint my bedroom. 	A2

Nisha told me you had an accident last week. 	A2

Now you're sixteen, I totally understand that you don't want to go on holiday with your parents. 	B1

When I got there, I realised that I wasn't the only winner. 	B1

I think also that you should say to your parents that you want to try a new experience with your friends. 	B1

 When I said to my friends that I had met with him, they didn't believe me. 	B1

I'm going to get up early on Saturday. 	A2

Shall we go out this weekend to a concert? 	A2

We can meet up at 2 pm. 	A2

If you have time, you can come over and I will introduce you to my friends. 	A2

Every day I can see the sea when I wake up. 	A2

I will pick you up and arrange everything. 	A2

Ring me up or send me an email if you have any questions. 	A2

You may need to throw it away, it'll be too dirty after painting. 	A2

Could you come here by nine o'clock to help me out? 	A2

I needed to hang out because my life was too jam-packed and hectic. 	B1

 Its battery had run out. 	B1

She cried a lot. Her feelings, emotions were all scattered. But Lisa didn't give up. 	B1

Were it not for my university, I would give up this class immediately. 	B1

I must travel to Mexico City because I won a novel contest and I need to pick up my award. 	B1

So I opened the envelope and took out the letter. 	B1

She turned off the phone and walked to the bathroom. 	B1

I heard about this club when I was watching T.V. and I wanted to check it out. 	B1

I really like shopping for clothes, but I hate trying them on because always when I finish, the shop assistant shows me more clothes. 	B1

So, think it over and tell me what you decide to do. 	B1

Some species are dying out, and keeping such animals in zoos where they can give life to new generations is the only way to prevent them from becoming completely extinct. 	B2

The following day my grandpa didn?t show up. 	B2

If you are not good enough at reading, you'll end up wasting your time. 	B2

I don't need to use my imagination while I'm surfing the internet, but if I'm reading a book I can build up the whole surroundings and the characters in my own head. 	B2

I had already booked my seat on the ferry-boat to Athens and I couldn't put off my crossing. 	B2

I can surf the internet and look up some useful information. 	B2

The concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the hall. 	B2

I am glad that you have decided to take some time off and more glad because you are going to the U.S. 	B2

Another way is also to turn the computers off in the evenings. 	B2

It was necessary to call the electrician up. 	B2

If we can make these improvements, we might be able to work this problem out. 	B2

 I went to check them out last week and here is my review of the two concerts. 	C1

 I tried to clean it up as much as possible. 	C1

 We just need a small set and a little time to fix it up. 	C1

You know, I love your cooking! 	A1

I have very good friends. 	A1

She comes from India. 	A1

She has long, dark hair and brown eyes. 	A1

He gets up at 6 o'clock and goes to work. 	A1

I heard from our neighbours about you. 	A1

My grandmother lived in a village and I often went there. 	A1

I am 22 years old. 	A1

There are 4 rooms. 	A1

And I like my home because it's not too big and it's a very nice flat. 	A1

It was very nice. 	A1

I am writing to tell you what I do every day at college. 	A1

I'm working today. 	A1

We are going to the park. 	A1

Can you bring some music with you to the dinner. 	A1

I'll be very happy to help you. 	A1

I would like to eat some Spanish food. 	A1

It has been a long time since I saw you. 	A2

I have left my suitcase in your house. 	A2

Have you got a mobile phone? 	A2

I haven't emailed you in a long time. 	A2

 Yes, I do. I am really excited about the idea. 	A2

Do you like shopping? 	A2

Did you buy a new mobile phone? 	A2

I thought that I wouldn't find nice clothes for me, but surprisingly, I did. 	A2

Why didn't you come to my birthday party? 	A2

It makes me feel comfortable and the room looks bigger with the colour. 	A2

My bedroom will be blue because the colour blue always looks fresh and I like it if it's always fresh. 	A2

And I think we should go somewhere else to have a drink after the film. 	A2

Please wear some of your old and torn clothes because they might get dirty. 	A2

You've got to bring paintbrushes, paper and paint, that's all. 	A2

You don't have to bring anything except your clothes. 	A2

But we used to play together every single day! 	B1

I think you ought to join a gym and you should go for a walk at least three times a week. 	B1

You needn't worry about where we can stay. 	B2

I think that they are rather jealous because they daren't give up their car. 	B2

I like to go to the zoo. 	A1

Sometimes I don't like to go out because It's very cold. 	A1

I want to invite you for dinner. 	A1

I like to work with my teacher. 	A1

I don't like to eat at College. 	A1

I like reading lots of magazines. 	A1

I don't like doing homework in college. 	A1

I like learning grammar. 	A1

I like travelling by car. 	A1

I would like to meet you to give you some information about the Brannl State and the shops near her. 	A1

I'd like to invite you on Sunday about six o'clock in the evening. 	A1

I bought them because I hope to go to England this year and the weather isn't very good. 	A2

Please remember to bring your pyjamas and your tooth brush. 	A2

Don't forget to come. 	A2

I love to play football. 	A2

I love to cook. 	A2

I prefer to play football but I often go to the gym. 	A2

I hate to watch any sports. 	A2

I love cooking and also baking. 	A2

I love listening to music, especially hip-hop music. 	A2

I hate wearing trousers in summer. 	A2

I'd love to do the concert. 	A2

I'd love to hear it! 	A2

We enjoy playing the piano and singing together. 	A2

You know I really enjoy listening to music. 	A2

? it's one of the reasons I decided to change class. 	B1

I'm going to buy pictures to hang on the wall, because my room seems to be very cold and very unfriendly. 	B1

I would prefer to pay by cash. 	B1

I would prefer to meet you at six o'clock instead of four, at the café in my hometown. 	B1

I'd prefer to go on holiday with my friends. 	B1

I would like to stay there a few years to finish studying and to have my own money to start thinking of travelling. 	B1

So, would you mind telling Mr and Mrs Thomas. 	B1

I wanted to help him to make some friends. He's just like me. 	B1

I hope that it will help you to keep fit. 	B1

I hope my advice can help you choose where to go. 	B1

This house is terrible and I hope you can help me find something better. 	B1

I would like you to come to a picnic on Saturday. 	B1

I would like you to come to my office on 16th of May to discuss the terms of the contract. 	B1

Your parents want you to go on holiday with them this summer. 	B1

You asked me to tell you about one of my friends. 	B1

Let me know if it is suitable for you. 	B1

She makes me smile when I'm sad. 	B1

She always makes me laugh! 	B1

You are eighteen now, you can do what you want and they should let you do it. 	B1

I think you should talk with your parents and try to make them understand how you feel and what you prefer. 	B1

Maybe your parents are afraid of letting you go away by yourself, they still consider you their baby. 	B1

 ... we can't avoid using them because we are used to them. 	B2

I couldn't stand being there. 	B2

Moreover we may consider offering bonus schemes, to increase the staff's loyalty to our company. 	B2

If your boss doesn't mind you delaying, it could be a possible solution. 	B2

I could not stand people shouting at me, or taking pictures of me all day. It would be horrible. 	B2

Oh just one more thing: would you mind me staying in your flat again? 	B2

We imagine it being a frozen land, where the people are ?frozen? too - both 'inside' and 'outside'. 	B2

He said if you need to change the time, remember to contact him to make a new appointment. 	B2

I know it is difficult to get by with such a low salary but I am sure you have not stopped to think twice about your life. 	B2

I remember feeling very unhappy and confused all day long. 	B2

After I had a baby, I needed to stop working. 	B2

Then I heard someone screaming, I was afraid and I said to the others: "Let's go out, something is happening". 	B2

I think we can learn nothing by seeing animals out of their habitat: we cannot see them running or eating or hunting. 	B2

I would like to see it develop without any pollution and without destroying the environment. 	C1

Nowadays, it is very common in Argentina to hear people talk about the economic depression. 	C1

We in the student committee would hate to see all that space go to waste. 	C1

I am very much aware of my parents? mistakes and would hate to make the same ones. 	C2

My home is nice, there is a nice garden. 	A1

In my College there is a big library. 	A1

In my home there are two bedrooms, there's a kitchen, there's a bathroom and a living-room. 	A1

There are two bathrooms. 	A1

There are many shops and schools. 	A1

I think, in the park there are animals. 	A1

I need it because there is some money in it which I have to pay to someone. 	A2

There is some information about the new art class. 	A2

There's a lot of people there. 	A2

There's a lot of clothes but they are very cheap. 	A2

You can go to the town centre because there are a lot of shops in the town centre. 	A2

It's a very interesting place because there are a lot of pictures. 	A2

There isn't any noise. 	B1

The spring is the best time because there aren't too many tourists. 	B1

There wasn't any message on it, just a big word "DIE". 	B1

There weren't any people on the bus she took. 	B1

 There will be flying cars and buses, and big houses. 	B1

In the countryside there wouldn?t be so many people and there is nothing to do. 	B1

In the large school there might be a lot of people that you can meet. 	B1

I figured out that there had to be matches somewhere; Bob, who owned the cabin, had told me that it was well equipped. 	B2

In the library there needs to be school books and also other books and magazines. 	B2

There is going to be a theatre performance, a chess championship and last but not least, swimming races where the participants will win medals and a lot of prizes. 	B2

Because today is my birthday. 	A1

Martin is from Poland. 	A1

My house is very clean. 	A1

It looks good on you. 	A2

We will really become good pen-friends. 	A2

Make sure you wear something over your clothes so that they won't get dirty. 	A2

Because it sounds interesting. 	A2

I feel sorry for you. I hope you get better as soon as possible. 	A2

There are indeed many ways of doing this and it all seems very confusing. 	B2

The food is a little bit strange but tastes good. 	B2

Now the whole house appeared very unfamiliar to me. 	B2

Alice was so unhappy that she remained silent for a long time. 	B2

I am writing to inform you that there is some incorrect information which appears in The Student Tourist Guidebook you published last year. 	B2

It is 3 hours long, and if you want to pass it you will have to study very hard, it is very difficult. 	A2

If you buy a gift for me, please buy a book, because I love to read. 	A2

If you agree, we can go shopping after the film. 	A2

If you find it, call me. 	A2

If you want to come, just tell me. 	A2

If I have spare time I always read a book. 	A2

If you need to contact me, here is my number: 07938776341, so just call me. 	A2

If you need some help I'm here to organise the meeting or to make the invitations. 	A2

You can get to my house if you take the number 35 bus. 	A2

If you need more information, call me. 	A2

Bring some films if you want. 	A2

Call me if you like. 	A2

Please, come here wearing a white T-shirt and a skirt, or shorts if you prefer. 	A2

If you want I can help you with the music. 	A2

If you like, you could bring some drinks. 	A2

We can go by bus or if you prefer we can go in my car. 	A2

I talked to my parents and I think if you tell them your reasons, they will accept it. 	B1

I'm sure your parents will be happy if you go with them. 	B1

If you live in the countryside you will see beautiful nature. 	B1

I think that it would be very good if you start going to the gym or you start cycling. 	B1

I would be very glad if you come and visit us. 	B1

If you come to Brazil you can stay at my home. 	B1

Billy, if you are moving you should think a lot, first you have to go and see the two schools. 	B1

However, if you are looking for fun and excitement, I would go for the city. 	B1

But if you are going to live in a town you should choose the large school. 	B1

In addition, if you are going to travel, please choose your partner very carefully. 	B1

Maybe it would be more fun if you went with your friends. 	B1

If you went on holiday with your friends, where would you go? 	B1

But, if I was able to move, I would like to live near the coast, because I love the sea, I like sunbathing and swimming. 	B1

Well, if I were you I would go to a small school in the countryside because it's less complicated than going to a large school in a town. 	B1

If I were you, I would talk to everybody and tell them when are you free, and spend the summer with both friends and parents. 	B1

 If I were you, I would accept both of them. 	B1

I think I am going to pay by cash, unless you accept credit cards. 	B1

If I were you I'd go to work on foot, unless it's far away from your house. 	B1

But unless you do some sports activities you will gain a lot of weight. 	B1

If you wanted to do some outdoor activities, we could go fishing or even walking through the green fields. 	B1

If you arrived in town the day before, we could arrange accommodation for you at the nearest Hotel. 	B1

If they had not been there, I would have been very lonely. 	B1

If I hadn't gone to these horse-riding lessons, I wouldn't have lost my watch. 	B1

I realise that if I hadn't agreed with my parents to go to the concert I wouldn't have met Britney Spears. 	B1

Is the Sheraton Hotel ok for you? If not, call me as soon as possible. 	B1

Do you work on Sundays? If not, you could do exercise on Sundays. 	B1

I hope it's ok for you. If not, call me on my mobile phone. 	B1

Do you think we could have an extra class? If so, I'd like to do it to cover the work I'll miss. 	B1

Is it possible to pay by credit card? If so, which ones do you take? 	B1

As long as it involves children I'd be delighted to work for you during the summer. 	B2

If you're really eager to learn age doesn't really matter as long as you're willing to learn. 	B2

My client will most certainly ask for compensation covering all losses incurred, unless you manage to find out where the goods are. 	B2

Finally, I am pleased to inform you that we would like to offer a 10% discount provided you reserve office space for eighteen months. 	B2

Providing we implement the suggested actions I believe we can increase sales within the next six months, overcoming the current situation caused by the international situation. 	B2

I would suggest that you might bring a city map in case you lose your way. 	B2

All this could have been avoided, if the plan had been more flexible. 	C1

Several statements in the newspaper could have been avoided, if the writer had taken notice of the income results which were sent along with the other facts from the charity day. 	C1

However, I think I could have learned more if more individual tuition had been available. 	C1

I wrote this article referring to my own experience in London, hence I might have had a different opinion if I had gone to another city or country. 	C1

Furthermore I found little rooms where an employee could take a short nap if needed. 	C1

Meals are served, if requested, three times a day, unless picnic lunches are needed. 	C1

Women who want to start a career more often decide to be single or, if married, don't devote much time to the family. 	C1

If you should have any concerns about my choice, please tell me. 	C1

If you should have any problems, you can go to an information booth and you will be told which train you have to take to Hassau. 	C1

If you should get lost, don't hesitate to call us. 	C1

If you should have any further questions do not hesitate to contact us. 	C1

Should you require any further information about the program or any other detail please do not hesitate to ask for it. 	C1

Should there be a lack of mutual understanding a break-up is unavoidable. 	C1

Should we win your prize we would like to build a new school close to our production center, for the children of the area. 	C1

Should you fail to do so, we would have no choice but to take further action. 	C1

Had he been more experienced he would have known that these things always happen in this part of the world. 	C2

Had we known this fact we would have organised more activities within school hours. 	C2

Had we learnt from the mistakes of the past, we would have given up fighting each other a long time ago. 	C2

Had I known so many people from abroad were coming to visit our stand, I would have studied harder during my private lessons in the past. 	C2

Had this file fallen into enemy hands, it might have had disastrous effects on the Western world. 	C2

Had public transportation been an option I would have chosen that instead of my car. 	C2

Were I to win this travel scholarship, the country of my choice would be Japan. 	C2

Were you to compare people's views on animals to their views on food, you would find many similarities. 	C2

Were someone to decide that he did not want to go to university, he would have to face the consequences of his choice. 	C2

Were this suggestion to be put into practice, our town's personality would change completely from a small town to a port of call for a large number of visitors. 	C2

As a matter of fact, education is free and as a result they can attend whichever university they desire so long as they have the proper qualifications, of course. 	C2

I was allowed to bring my friends home and go out with them on condition that my parents knew where I was and when I was going to return. 	C2

Were it not for my university, I would give up this class immediately. 	B1

Were it not for that kind of toy, children would be able to gain more team-spirit, creativity and self-confidence. 	C2

In fact, were it not for that reason, Laura would have accepted the comfortable executive chair in a big company. 	C2

If it weren't for that boy, I am definitely certain that I would have failed the examinations and I would have ended up taking the class again the following year. 	C2

If it weren't for his determination, he would have resigned when he first heard "no". 	C2

If it were to be published, the first issue would probably include a small introduction about the people who helped in the creation of the magazine. 	C1

However displacing such a number of commuters will need a lot of planning and a very good infrastructure if it were to succeed. 	C2

Whether or not the visitors should imitate local customs and behaviour is definitely a debatable issue.	C2

Whether or not it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools has been a widely discussed issue in recent years. 	C2

Whether or not richer countries should help these poor nations is a very controversial issue, there are people on both sides of the argument who have very strong feelings. 	C2

However, it depends only on the children whether or not they'll go to a university and there are many factors to be considered before deciding on going. 	C2

I can't come to your wedding because, as you know, I live in England and on Thursday 18th July I'm going to take the FCE exam. 	A2

As you know, my parents are leaving home tomorrow night to go to Spain. 	A2

So, what do you think? 	A2

 I have got an appointment with my dentist.  So, I'm really sorry about that and I'm getting so sad. 	A2

I'll be free at 15.00. So, I'll be at your house at 15.30. 	A2

Firstly, we need a good expert to run the course.	B1

Secondly, good materials are needed. 	B1

Secondly, I know you like a healthy life so if you don't eat too much candy and unhealthy food, you can keep fit easily. And lastly, please believe in yourself, I know you can do it, and don't give up the exercise. 	B1

Finally, I would be grateful if you would arrange a car from this airport. 	B1

First of all, I must tell you that it always depends on how badly you want to do something. 	B1

On the one hand going to a large school is better for making friends, but on the other hand I think you can learn better in a small school. 	B1

My new teacher, on the contrary, understands us and I think she is skilful, because during the first lesson she organised a game. 	B1

Moreover the health of our staff and customers is essential. 	B1

In addition it is wonderful to see the prize that the winner gets at the end, sometimes it is money or a nice holiday. 	B1

Besides, you're 18 years old and you aren't a baby. 	B1

What is more, you could go to "Estadio Centerano" to watch football matches and to Maroias to go horseriding. 	B1

Furthermore, I think that you should do some small exercises during your break, for example you could go running in the morning and evening. 	B1

You see, in the park, you can enjoy fresh air. 	B1

The thing is, if I could move I'd go to the countryside. 	B1

Unfortunately, they filmed only the building and the garden, not the students! 	B1

Actually, I do not have much time to watch television. 	B1

Surprisingly, the suitcase was Lucy's. 	B1

 But some countries celebrate on other dates too, like they have Chinese New Year according to their calendar.  Likewise, in Nepal New Year is celebrated on 1st of Baishak, which is the start of a new year according to the Nepalese calendar. 	B2

This group is expected to decrease considerably in the next fifty years. Similarly, the population of children are likely to drop to 11.5% in 2050. 	B2

When you read a letter from someone, you can imagine and almost feel the emotions of that someone. In the same way, when you read a book, you can feel the author's sensations, travel to distant places or participate in adventures only possible in your imagination. 	B2

To begin with, I want to ensure that you are going to have a great time with us. 	B2

For a start, we have lived with books for thousands of years while television is only half a century old. 	B2

In conclusion, if people in zoos look after the animals, it isn't cruel to keep an animal in zoo. 	B2

To sum up, I think that whether you use a car or a bicycle depends on several aspects: where you live, when you work, the weather, and also the kind of job you do. 	B2

In summary I would like to say that the majority of students is willing to help with cleaning, collecting the rubbish or even giving up their cars. 	B2

Thus, I would be very grateful if you would send me clear explanations of the following points: firstly, I would like you to specify what 'the normal price' is, and therefore what would be the cost of two nights. 	B2

Consequently, visiting zoos can help people learn about nature. 	B2

Hence, there is a great need to improve the situation of those animals so that their life would not become life imprisonment. 	B2

Therefore, we are likely to enter the market as a pioneer, which will have a lot of benefits. 	B2

As mentioned above, it might be possible to negotiate better contracts for your company. 	C1

I hope this brief note has convinced you to start this club. As mentioned earlier, I have already asked for information. 	C1

So as shown above, I recommend TELECARS to be our car services supplier because it offers all we need. 	B2

My mother said that she can take us there. 	A2

The teacher said that we have to bring a notebook, a pencil and a rubber. 	A2

 It's very important to me to have it with me because my brother is in the hospital and my father told me that he will call. 	A2

My sister told me that this film is very good. 	A2

Gill told me that you had an accident last week. 	A2

I immediately called her to see if everything was o.k. and she said that she had won the lottery and she wanted to give some of the money to me. 	B1

He said that she was in big trouble because the phone was a bomb. 	B1

They said that our school was the most suitable school for that movie. 	B1

He said that it was his phone and he had left it in a cafe. 	B1

He said that he was a nuclear scientist and we had met before. 	B1

Mary told me that she was dating John. 	B1

In the letter, he told me that he was coming to Madrid on the first of June and he asked me if I was free. 	B1

You asked me if I like shopping. 	B1

I am asking you if we can change the time of the meeting to 5.00 pm. 	B1

A very rich movie producer asked her if she wanted to be in a movie, he said she would get paid 500,000 dollars, she agreed. 	B1

I asked her if she wanted to go and have dinner together. 	B1

Renata, a really good friend of mine, told me she was in this club, but she left it some time ago; she asked me if I was interested in joining this amazing club. 	B1

I'm writing to ask whether you're free next Saturday or not. 	B1

I asked why she was here. 	B1

I phoned and asked what sports we could play in this club. 	B1

When we asked why they were filming our school, they said they were looking for a location where they could film some boys and girls leaving the school and so they filmed us! 	B1

He saw a guy sat there so he sat next to him and asked where the football players were. 	B1

They filmed it and interviewed a few pupils about what they think about the new swimming pool in the gym and I asked when it would be on TV. 	B1

I always had good times with her and was very impatient to read this letter: I wondered what she had written. 	B1

I really wondered who he was, but I was embrassed to look at him. 	B1

He felt like a worm too and he said to me: "I'm sorry I'm not a good friend". 	B1

Maria answered "Yes!? 	B1

He answered: "Come with me". 	B1

Then I thought: "I can't stay in prison". 	B1

He asked "Are you Clarice?" I answered yes and then he told me that he was my father. 	B1

She asked me "How about we join the club?" 	B1

She thought: "Should I go to the police or should I go back?? 	B1

I thought: "Either I talk to her now or I won't be able to talk to her anytime!? 	B1

?Excuse me Sir, but you forgot your mobile phone," she said. 	B1

"I must take it to the police station," she thought. 	B1

"Yes of course," she answered. 	B1

?What have I done?" I thought. 	B1

?What should I do?? she asked herself. 	B1

"But where is everybody? Am I alone?" I asked. 	B1

"What's your name?" he asked. 	B1

She asked me to come back as soon as possible because my father is seriously ill. 	B1

As the concert finished, I heard someone call my name, I turned and there were two men from security who asked me to go up on the stage. 	B1

Dad asked me to help him at work. 	B1

He told me to go outside the concert hall and wait for him to come. 	B1

I have caught a cold and my doctors told me to rest in bed for a few days. 	B1

They told me to stay in the car and watch them and try to remember their faces. 	B1

At the airport they told him to come the next morning. 	B1

The trainer was impressed and said that if I play next time as well as this time, I'll be the 'pointing guard' in the team. 	B1

The letter said that he is coming home next month. 	B1

Her husband told me that the following day they would return to Germany so that was the last time I saw Sara. 	B1

"No problem", I thought, "there is only one person". 	B2

"We have come together", this man said, "to celebrate our annual meeting and to call our master's ghost tonight!? 	B2

"No problem", I thought, "there is only one person". 	B2

"Forgive me, sweetheart", he said, "I will never leave you alone again.? 	B2

"I was astonished when I saw them standing there", said John. 	B2

"Who are you?" asked Peter. 	B2

"Would you mind lending me a part of your newspaper?" said a whispering voice. 	B2

What do you think about this? said the Inspector to the policeman. 	B2

"So this is a real cow, mom?" she asked doubtfully. 	B2

"A hundred dollars for one day. Is that a deal?" her husband said forcefully. 	B2

"Come on, what's wrong?" Bella asked curiously. 	B2

"Put that light out!" I shouted calmly. 	B2

Meanwhile, she told me not to be scared but the place was very... old. 	B2

I told him not to climb the wall but he was so interested in doing movements that he did not listen to me. 	B2

Arriving there, my father told me not to go far and to stay near him. 	B2

I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. 	B2

First of all, your advertisement says that you have got two great nights in a hotel for us. 	B2

It says you are asking for people to help in a summer camp for foreign school children. 	B2

Firstly, your advertisement  tells  us that hotel has two great nights in a wonderful 3-star hotel 	B2

The guidebook says that we can get there by train from London. 	B2

I was wondering why I failed. 	B2

So, he was wondering why we didn't have our letters. 	B2

I was thinking which of the two would be more interesting, and I prefer to go to "Can Animals Speak", since I love them and I have two. So, I want to know how to communicate with them. 	B2

We were wondering what had happened for a few minutes but then we realised that there had been a power cut. 	B2

While he was thinking how to reply, Jenny took his hand and led him to the school. 	B2

She had told me the previous day that she had something important to tell me. 	B2

We met Daisy at school on the following day and we told her that the previous day we had been at her house; her grandfather had told us that unluckily she wasn't at home. 	B2

My boss had told me the previous day that an important customer was going to visit the company in the morning. 	B2

I had told my friends the day before that I expected to get an A! 	B2

In the morning, I go to the beach. 	A2

In my country, the most popular food is Paella, which is a kind of rice with seafood, really tasty. 	A2

From your house, take the first turning on your left after the roundabout. 	A2

That's my diary, the dearest thing I had. Here I wrote how I felt, what I did, who I met and all my problems. 	B1

Quickly I opened the envelope, took out a white piece of paper and started to read. 	B1

Suddenly, the door opened. 	B1

Outside, it wasn't a sunny day any longer, it was raining a lot. 	B1

It's great that you have got a new job! 	B1

It's true that there are one or two programmes that are interesting or funny, but the rest... they're horrible! 	B1

It's important that you are happy. 	B1

It is really sad that you have to move to a different area. 	B1

The reason I am writing is to suggest a few things about our holidays. 	B2

The reason that I never continued taking lessons is that my school-work became too heavy and the costs of lessons were too expensive for me as a student. 	B2

The place you need is called "Academiuta". 	B2

The place we appreciated the most was the Cap Frehel, where nature is still wild and the birds feel at home. 	B2

The place which has impressed me most of all in my life is Abastumani. 	B2

The reason is I like children, I have experience of looking after disabled people and I like to do things like volunteering. 	B2

The problem is I know myself, I am always late when I have to leave my house so I need a car to go faster. 	B2

The fact is that not all animals are able to deal with this. 	B2

The fact is science needs computers to increase knowledge and businesses need them like the air we breathe. 	B2

It is true that a lot of accidents are caused by cars. The point is that the car itself does not cause the accident. 	B2

The thing is, Alison is an eleven-year-old girl who has been, together with her father, left behind by her mother when she was just three. 	B2

At the end of the day everything is up to you! 	C1

All in all, the activity week was a nice experience for both students and teachers. 	C1

All things considered, I would recommend the third proposal as it seems to me that it covers most of the points the students have been complaining about. 	C1

When it comes down to it, who does not like such a surprise? 	C1

When you think about it, can we afford a flat in Central London and still have something left with a basic salary? 	C1

Note the disadvantages of this transfer. 	C1

Notice the difference in the salary. 	C1

See the written instructions on the phone for complete instruction. 	C1

What we need is a strong publicity campaign, directed at young people. 	C1

What everyone loved were the special effects and we were very impressed by the use of advanced technological innovations. 	C1

What companies care about is money and football players help them to earn it. 	C1

What tourists want is to see the most typical things in England, not a hamburger restaurant or a London musical from the back row in the gallery. 	C1

What students learn are mostly facts and theories. 	C1

What I found particularly fascinating about this story is that it is still exciting and thrilling, despite the plot being rather easy to follow. 	C1

People are sensitive, and when they hear about charities, they always want to help. 	C1

If you fund this event, you will gain in two ways: firstly you will help needy people, and secondly you will be admired. 	C1

How I investigated. First I started looking on the internet in general. 	C1

This drink will be taken by athletes of any kind. 	C1

Compared to other European capitals, there has been a lot done to make riding a bike less dangerous and more comfortable in Berlin. 	C1

Outlined below are some essential reasons which justify my choice and should be seriously considered. 	C1

Not a word was spoken by anyone throughout the journey. 	C2

Not a scrap of remorse do they have. 	C2

How we are brought up forms our character, our thinking and our attitude towards ourselves and towards everybody and everything around us. 	C2

Where he had gone to was a mystery. 	C2

How they influenced my life is hard to tell. 	C2

Why I think my father is successful is because of his personality, he is very fair about everything,; for example if he sees two beautiful women walking down the street and you ask him which is the nicest of them, he couldn't tell even if one was plain ugly he couldn't. 	C2

 How people have got their objects is also important. 	C2

The sad thing about it was that it was actually Richard who said, "Why don't you go on holiday?' 	C2

The strange thing was that the noise reminded her of someone making a cup of tea. 	C2

The sad fact is, poverty is very likely to pass down to the next generation in these situations. 	C2

The relevant point is that that personal, almost intimate relationship between the possessor and the thing possessed is at the core of that particular love we all hold for certain things. 	C2

The only problem is that they are a little too noisy in the night. 	C2

It is Lily who decides to go to the seaside and it is also her who kills the turkey given by a lorry-driver. 	C2

It was Paul who stole the money. 	C2

It is Piggy who finds the conch and knows how to blow it. 	C2

It is my mother who always plays the role of mediator. 	C2

It is this silence that gives me the impression of togetherness, for which no words are needed. 	C2

But all of a sudden, out of nowhere a bunch of people came running towards him, yelling something he couldn't understand. 	C2

All in all, taking everything into account, I would suggest that a leisure centre would be the most beneficial as it provides all the facilities necessary to attract and benefit a number of people in the community. 	C2

What is more, from my point of view happiness has nothing to do with big things but with small things such as day-to-day details. 	C2

My college is not very big. 	A1

I know you are not well. 	A1

I'm not a good swimmer. 	A1

This place isn't big. 	A1

I don't have a dining room, so we eat in the living room. 	A1

We don't like other lessons, for example: French language. 	A1

In winter, we can't go visiting because it is too cold. 	A1

I can't find my CD. 	A1

The gas is not working. 	A2

The window is broken and is not closing. 	A2

Now, I haven't got any money, but I am really happy! 	A2

I haven't tidied my room since I bought this mobile. 	A2

We have not got hot water so the water is very cold. 	A2

It was very sad that you didn't come to my birthday party but it's ok. 	A2

I didn't spend a lot of money: only £143. 	A2

Don't forget your electric guitar. 	A2

Don't be late. 	A2

I'm sorry I can't come to your wedding because I am very sick. 	A2

Sorry but I won't be in town on Wednesday 17th. 	A2

You shouldn't wear formal clothes. 	A2

I bought a shirt, because I haven't got any. 	A2

As regards close friends, I don't have many. 	B1

Come at 5.00 pm. Don't bring anything. 	A2

I bought these clothes because I need them for my new job, but now I have no money because they cost £250. 	A2

I had no clothes to wear at John's party, so I went shopping yesterday. 	A2

I bought them because I didn't have any shirts or hats. 	A2

I have only spent £25 because I haven't much money. 	A2

I'm in Bilbao, and here I haven't got many things to do. 	A2

It was raining for seventy two hours and it wasn't going to stop. 	B1

I hadn't expected to receive a letter from her. 	B1

But I don't think it'll help you. 	B1

I don't think I'll live here forever because I intend to move to Curitiba, a southern city of my country. 	B1

I don't believe that the suitcase will be returned to me. 	B1

Can't you go with your parents some time and with your friends later? 	B1

Don't you think it's fun? 	B1

Aren't you excited about it? 	B1

You're free on Saturday , aren't you? 	B1

I think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it? 	B1

Isn't it marvellous? 	B1

Don't you think it's fantastic? 	B1

You love books, don't you? 	B1

I said I had nothing, but he didn't believe me. 	B1

I haven't seen anything yet. 	B1

I didn't tell anyone about this story at first. 	B1

Nobody will ever know who that man was. 	B1

I stayed there for two weeks and it never rained. 	B1

I haven't decided yet. 	B1

But I still don't believe her. 	B1

But every time a small envelope arrived, I ripped it open as fast as I could. Not this time. 	B1

I would like to apologise for not being able to attend on Friday 13th June for my visit. 	B1

The picnic will be held in the park three kilometres away from the city center so it will be quiet and not crowded. 	B1

Well, I think it will be better for you to go to a large school in the centre of the town and not to the small school. 	B1

Do not take on too many assignments at a time. 	B2

I cannot agree with you Mr Brown. 	B2

Keeping them in zoos will not help them. 	B2

Never have I seen such a realistic and impressive film before. 	B2

Never had I thought that my parents would do this to me. 	B2

Neither you nor I would like that. 	B2

We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. 	B2

I have neither climbed nor surfed before, so that would be very exciting for me. 	B2

Neither of us is liable in this case. 	B2

Moreover, none of my friends are interested therefore there is no one I can talk to. 	B2

We even met a French group and as none of them spoke English, we stayed with them to translate what they were asked. 	B2

In fact, there are none, but the hills that do exist can be dubbed mountains - just because there are none... 	C1

Concerning your question about any special requirements of some students - I am glad that I am able to tell you that there are none this year. 	C1

Problems when using English? None. 	C1

Not everyone likes sports or music. 	C1

Not everything was as good as we expected. 	C1

Not all students, though, can attend the centre as it is not always open, and their lessons finish at 5 pm, the closing time of the centre. 	C1

Not all of us have got the fighting spirit to visit the gym regularly, but many of us would like to have a healthy look. 	C1

Not every cyclist is a danger to the public as most of them obey all rules and respect other road users. 	C1

Not only was it in a wonderful location, with extraordinary views, but it was also very accessible and the shops were really near. 	C1

Not only do they have the biggest turnover overall, they also managed to increase it constantly from 2000 to 2002. 	C1

This is not necessarily the way the older generation would see it, though. 	C1

Being a passionate student of the English language, you do not necessarily need a teacher to guide you through the meanders of English. 	C1

I'm not sure what exactly they would expect us to do at the campsite, but organising the entertainment is not really my thing. 	C1

Personally, I do not actually think that this relationship will change. 	C1

They were sent to Britain to improve their English but few had any real contact with the language. 	C1

English is the most spoken language nowadays and although most of the people can speak a bit of English, very few speak it in the right way. 	C1

The Greeks have always been a tortured folk; everyone tried to conquer them, but few managed. 	C1

This means that nothing shall change for the employees, there shall be no implication whatsoever for their rights stipulated in their employment contracts. 	C1

Organising the entertainment would be rather fun, whilst waiting tables would be boring and we have no experience whatsoever. 	C1

Not a single noise could be heard from inside of any of the rooms. 	C2

Not a long time passes before another Polish city, Warsaw, hosts a festival. 	C2

Not a single member of the group would have imagined that the "Luxury coach" would break down and leave them stranded in the middle of nowhere. 	C2

Don't you ever do that again! 	C2

Don't you dare! 	C2

Don't you dare forget me, I want letters from you promptly, understand! 	C2

There are also considerable disturbances during day-time. It is, for example, not possible to lead a conversation, e.g. on the veranda, without shouting. Nor is it possible to watch television peacefully without the thunderous noise in the background. 	C2

At first, I didn?t pay attention to the large number of magazines and newspapers she subscribed to. Neither did I oppose her 'need' to get new clothes every month. 	C2

She has lost her little brother but that does not discourage her in the least. 	C2

Most of the times, the director of a television channel is not in the least interested in the quality, but only in the matter of how many people watch their programmes. 	B2

What others say doesn't matter in the least. 	C2

You could come by bus, and we could meet at the bus station. 	A2

We could go to the museum near Cibeles. 	A2

 Too bad you couldn't come. 	A2

I couldn't close the window. 	A2

?he was ill, so he could not go to the game. 	A2

Could you help me? 	A2

Could we meet on Friday afternoon? 	A2

 I couldn't work without it. 	A2

I couldn't buy the T-shirt because it was too expensive, but the other things were very nice and quite cheap, so I bought them. 	A2

Could you help me to paint my bedroom? 	A2

I left my umbrella in your house yesterday. ? Could you bring it to school tomorrow, please? 	A2

We could have dinner after that, if you want. 	A2

If you want to visit an interesting place near Paris, you could go to Versailles. 	A2

We could take the bus, or we could ask my parents to take us there. 	A2
