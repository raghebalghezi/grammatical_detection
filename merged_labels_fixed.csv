924	I live with my mother and her boyfriend. 	A
925	Our house has four rooms, one bathroom and one toilet. 	A
926	It's very important for me because it's my sister's jacket. 	A
927	I'll wear them at Linda's party. 	A
928	All of my friends were there. 	A
929	I bought some T-shirts and jeans, because some of my clothes are too small for me. 	A
930	Bring some of your DVDs. 	A
931	But after that I saw that I spent all of my money! 	A
932	I spent a long time receiving presents, all of my family were here. 	A
933	They were having the time of their lives, watching all the animals the zoo had, but when they returned to their car, they saw that someone was stealing Paul's suitcase. 	B
934	They filmed the artists and their work. 	B
935	I couldn't see their faces. 	B
936	When I go out with my friends, I actually like wearing clothes that attract people's attention. 	B
937	The second reason is: it is too far from the children's school and, unfortunately, I haven't got a car. 	B
938	It was the biggest TV in the bazaar with its huge, black screen. 	B
939	The journey was quite long but Verona is a great city, with its buildings and churches. 	B
940	They've chosen my school because of its size. 	B
941	 yet everyone has their preference for one or another. 	B
942	Everyone has their own opinion. 	B
943	IBM is a very important customer for us and they ordered 10,000 colour copies which show their new product. 	B
944	I decided to spend the rest of my holiday in my parents' house, near the sea. 	B
945	So, if you want to study animals' behaviour, try to do it without changing the real circumstances in which they act! 	B
946	Actually, I know a great one and they can make a little discount for us because the owner is a friend of my father's . 	B
947	Living in Greece, I have had a chance to realise how much tourism can affect one's life. 	C
948	After one has spent enough time away from one 's parents and has a personality of one's own, it is definitely possible to move in with one's parents. 	C
949	In my opinion, this process depends on one's ability to open another way of communicating apart from one's mother language. 	C
950	However, I believe that in order to maintain its popularity, the programme should keep some of the series' aspects the same, but alter some others. 	C
951	Olivia's experiences probably are the narrator's. 	C
952	He started to shake me and meanwhile I heard a familiar voice; it was my father's. 	C
953	Suddenly, after two weeks I realised that my bank account was empty and so was my friend's. 	C
954	There were no photographs of him in Ann 's mother's albums. 	C
955	They spent two weeks together at Emily's grandmother's house, after fourteen months of dating. 	C
956	Near my home there are some shops. 	A
957	My house has got three rooms. 	A
958	I had a lot of friends in this town. 	A
959	For homework we have to write lots of things. 	A
960	In my home are 3 bedrooms. I have a big kitchen and small toilet. 	A
961	The first floor has two bedrooms and a big bathroom with a bath. 	A
962	I go to India every year to see my friends and family. 	A
963	I go to college every day. 	A
964	This notice is for all students: we are going to have a concert at school. 	A
965	It was exciting as both teams played well, but India won the match. 	A
966	I'm just writing to say hello, and to tell you a few things. 	A
967	I think we should bring some water to drink. 	A
968	I bought them because I don't have any clothes for the summer and I need them! 	A
969	The weather was great. There were no clouds. 	A
970	I want to see that film but I have no time today because I have more work at home. 	A
971	If you want more details, you can call this number. 	A
972	We will meet at my house at 10.15, so we will have more time in the club. 	A
973	We danced, played games and had lots of fun . 	A
974	The new art class starts next Monday and each class is about 1 hour long. 	A
975	Yesterday I bought three t-shirts: one blue t-shirt, one pink t-shirt and one yellow t-shirt. 	A
976	We have an extra ticket and are wanting you to come. 	A
977	But we didn't have much money, so we didn't buy many things. 	A
978	I want to sell the television because I haven't got much time to watch it. 	A
979	There aren't many tickets. 	A
980	I bought them because I haven't got many winter clothes. 	A
981	We played so many games, like dog and bone, four corners, and many more. 	A
982	We visited so many places, mostly monuments. The weather was perfect. 	A
983	I know, I bought too many things but I liked all of them. 	A
984	I spent all of my money! 	A
985	Some of my friends gave me books. 	A
986	The competition was very tough because both of the teams were good. 	A
987	Many of my relatives and friends had come. 	A
988	I enjoyed the party. I had invited five of my friends and my family. 	A
989	Without a library card you can't take any of the books with you. 	A
990	So several days ago we received a complaint. 	B
991	I took it and wished to have millions of dollars. 	B
992	They interviewed a few of the students, the teachers and the headmistress. 	B
993	I went with my friends so we could spend a little time together. 	B
994	I had a bit of free time, so I took the bus and I went to my friend's house. 	B
995	I just watch a little bit of TV when I come home from school. 	B
996	I'm convinced that most people watch too much TV these days. 	B
997	If you haven't got enough credit on your phone, we can meet at 11 am at the bookshop. 	B
998	I think if we meet at 8 pm, we'll have plenty of time to buy the tickets and some drinks. 	B
999	We went to loads of beautiful places. 	B
1000	How much television do you watch? 	B
1001	Do you watch much TV? 	B
1002	Hello Marina. Unfortunately I have so much work at the moment that I can't help you. 	B
1003	My neighbours are making too much noise. 	B
1004	Have you got many friends in England? 	B
1005	 How many channels are there in Britain? 	B
1006	In my opinion you should spend half of your holiday with your parents and the other half with your friends: I think this would be the best thing to do. 	B
1007	Anyway that's enough of my news! 	B
1008	Although I knew which kind of dress I wanted, none of the stores had it. 	B
1009	Because almost all of the programmes are stupid. 	B
1010	His name is Richard and since we were just little kids, we've spent nearly every day together. 	B
1011	I spend very little time outside, and I know I do not have enough stamina and strength. 	B
1012	We are sick of working hard for so little money. 	B
1013	There are so few animals living on the earth today and the pandas have so few places left to live and to eat, so we must try helping these animals. 	B
1014	Second, we would draw your attention to the fact that neither party could foresee or predict the recent rise in the price of wheat. 	C
1015	In the Czech Republic, somewhere between those two extremes, either way is possible. 	C
1016	This way, the toilet can be accessed easily from either floor. 	C
1017	Either of the measures is recommended and those measures are bound to enhance the company's competitive power. 	C
1018	Of course if you are not at all interested in sports, neither of these games will be of any interest to you. 	C
1019	However, you forgot to add that neither of us could foresee the rise in the price of wheat. 	C
1020	My kitchen is absolutely cramped. I love cooking and despite the fact that I have no space, I managed to fit in a table as well as millions of cookbooks and all the necessary kitchen tools. 	C
1021	I'm going to make loads of cookies this year and will give them in nice little boxes to my family and friends. 	C
1022	I received tons of plastic ducks every time I had my birthday or some kind of celebration. 	C
1023	We have come a long way and climbed many a mountain but are we really better off than our ancestors? 	C
1024	Her father's pharmacy was broken into very often, the local drug addicts were relentless and Mary was threatened many a time on her way home from work. 	C
1025	It has raised many an issue which I would like to comment upon here. 	C
1026	I'll be waiting for you. 	A
1027	We will be starting at 12 o'clock this afternoon. 	A
1028	Tomorrow please come at 4.30 pm because I'll be working before. 	A
1029	Tomorrow I'll be studying in the morning, so you can come at 2. 	A
1030	However, I shall be attending class the day after tomorrow and I shall cover the work I miss by copying it from John. 	B
1031	We will be waiting for you at the River's Café at 6.30. 	B
1032	I would like you to know that I won't be attending your English class next week. 	B
1033	I won't be coming because my family and I are going on a tour of London. 	B
1034	Will they be holding any activities at night? 	B
1035	Will I be needing any money? 	B
1036	What will you be doing in a few years if now you don't even try to do anything? 	B
1037	Will I be needing any money? 	B
1038	As far as I'm concerned, we should definitely do some additional publicity, particularly for the new offerings which might be coming up. 	C
1039	For example, your boss may be calling at 10 pm asking you to prepare a report for next day's meeting. 	C
1040	You are not going to believe what I am about to tell you! 	B
1041	I'm in a hurry, my class is about to begin. 	B
1042	They are to offer the spectators a view of the variety and the beauty of the world we are surrounded by and which we are about to destroy. 	B
1043	I am afraid that July is the only appropriate month, because I am due to start work in August. 	B
1044	As some of the members of our team are due to be present at a sales promotion programme next Friday, the marketing meeting once scheduled for next Friday is postponed to next Saturday. 	B
1045	Dear Erica, I am sorry that I cannot attend the meeting at head office as expected, as I am to go on a business trip to New York then. 	B
1046	He is to come to Athens next Friday. 	B
1047	I know what you 're about to answer, and moreover you might be right; 	B
1048	We're about to introduce a new identity card system in our company. 	B
1049	My company has a high reputation for manufacturing healthy foods and we are just about to launch a newly-developed healthy snack for children which requires financial backing urgently. 	B
1050	 We have no right to do so, because they are to be respected as much as any other living form on this planet! 	B
1051	They are to have their passports with them. 	B
1052	You're to sit in front of the TV and just watch the film. 	B
1053	Our annual conference for HR managers is due to take place on 10 December 2010. 	B
1054	However, the demand for products is still estimated as ‘normal’ and is due to increase within the next 6 months. 	B
1055	I am sorry but we are to leave a bit earlier - at about 16.00. 	B
1056	She was going to return it but she saw something very strange, her number was on the screen. 	B
1057	She didn't know what was going to happen. 	B
1058	We were going to meet two days later in the square next to the centre. 	B
1059	I've just bought a new dress, and a beautiful black T-shirt. When I saw them, I thought they would be great for tonight's party. 	B
1060	 we thought that the film would be horrible because of the title but when the film started, the story was beautiful and Mauricio and I liked it a lot. 	B
1061	As I saw the advert, I knew it would be a lovely birthday present. 	B
1062	Two days before, I told him that our father was about to buy a brand new car. 	B
1063	When I was about to answer the question, I realised that it was not as easy as I had thought. 	B
1064	Dear Helen, Believe it or not, I was just about to write you a letter when I received yours. 	B
1065	Just as we were about to climb through the broken window, a policeman arrived on the scene. 	B
1066	In addition, when I was on the point of leaving the office, another phone rang. 	B
1067	In fact he simulated his death to escape from the police, who were on the point of catching him fora penicillin racket. 	B
1068	It was quite early in the morning, only 7.15 am, and my plane was due to leave in about 40 minutes. 	C
1069	Ten minutes after the time we were due to begin, she arrived. 	C
1070	We have succeeded in persuading the local Council that the factory that was due to be built near the lake was dangerous. 	C
1071	This summer I will have been working for three years for my company  	B
1072	Now I am staying in Hastings in England and this month, I will have been studying English for seven months. 	B
1073	I think I could have a holiday just in July because I will have been working for my company for one year by the end of the June. 	B
1074	I do not think that this aspect is really necessary because it is supposed that  you will have been studying very hard to occupy that job . 	C
1075	I'm sure I will have learned today's lesson by the next lesson. 	B
1076	It seems that the decorative role of clothes will have disappeared by the year 2050. 	B
1077	I think that the best time for me to visit Scotland would be in July, because I will not have finished my university exams by June. 	B
1078	 Once we have finished, it we won't have done more than 40 km, and there are just another 10 to get to the Lakeside Inn. 	B
1079	There is no problem if you want to leave at 4.30 pm as the match will have finished by that time. 	B
1080	First of all, if you go to work by bicycle every day, at the end of the month you will have saved more money because you won't have spent it buying petrol. 	B
1081	If you have ever read a fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen you will surely have discovered why this man is so famous worldwide. 	C
1082	However, sales will possibly have fallen to 5000 units again by the end of the year. 	C
1083	As you will have heard, this year's work experience programme in Britain was in general a success. 	C
1084	All of this is because her book will have included the cultural traditions that go with the dishes. 	C
1085	 I hope I will have reassured you. 	C
1086	Will he have changed? 	C
1087	I will see you soon. 	A
1088	I'll come at 7 o'clock. 	A
1089	I will try to come to see you tomorrow. 	A
1090	I'll bring a football ball with me. 	A
1091	I shall come with you. 	A
1092	We shall take a bus to the sports centre. 	A
1093	We shall go together next year! 	A
1094	Without them I will not be able to play football. 	A
1095	Can you come at 7 o'clock? I won't be at home before.  	A
1096	Will you come? 	A
1097	And what shall I bring to the party? 	A
1098	Shall I wait for you? 	A
1099	Shall I buy you one? 	A
1100	Will you have a mobile phone? 	A
1101	Will you come by train? 	A
1102	Will you come tomorrow at 6.35 pm to my house? 	A
1103	 Will you send it for me? 	A
1104	Shall we go to my friend's house to get it? 	A
1105	Shall we go there together? 	A
1106	My mother will drive us there. 	A
1107	 and my elder sister will help us too. 	A
1108	The work will start at 8 a.m. and finish at 2 p.m. The new schedule starts on 1 June. 	B
1109	I won't be able to get there at the time we agreed. 	B
1110	It will be hotter because of global warming.  	B
1111	But, if you go on holiday with your parents, there are some advantages too: you will not have money problems and your parents will not worry about you too much! 	B
1112	I won't live here in the future, because in March I'm moving to Lima, to study at the university. 	B
1113	I promise that I shall cover all the work and give it to you tomorrow. 	B
1114	After that, I shall go to the beach. 	B
1115	We shall have a meeting regarding this next week. 	B
1116	However, we shall not forget to mention the legal and social consequences of such a merger to the average employees. 	C
1117	Therefore, my client shall not release you from the agreement, which is binding upon both parties. 	C
1118	I must believe, believe in myself and in everybody else, and mainly in what I look for, this way I shall never lose hope. 	C
1119	I shall always remember it as the city of lights. 	C
1120	I shall always keep it in mind, in order to keep my children close to me and avoid being hated. 	C
1121	I came to the conclusion that the Excel Academy is not worth the money our company paid and that we shall not send further candidates there. 	C
1122	Once more I invite you wholeheartedly to stay at my place and I hope we shall meet in November. 	C
1123	 we shall probably have several years more to live. 	C
1124	 I 'm going to wear them on holiday. 	A
1125	It is going to start at half past four. 	A
1126	 It's going to be hot. 	A
1127	We are going to take a taxi to get to the sports centre. 	A
1128	What are you going to wear? 	A
1129	What colour paint are we going to use? 	A
1130	Are you going to come tomorrow evening? 	A
1131	I'm going to use pink paint. 	A
1132	My mum is going to take us by car. 	A
1133	What time are you going to come? And what are you going to bring?  	A
1134	I think this Saturday is going to be a nice day. 	A
1135	It's going to be fantastic. 	A
1136	It is going to be great fun. 	A
1137	You should wear comfortable clothes because you are going to be hot. 	A
1138	I am not going to go to school tomorrow. 	B
1139	Also you can do whatever you want because there is not going to be an adult there to stop you. 	B
1140	When we realized it was going to be an extremely hot day, we took water. 	B
1141	We were going to meet at 11.30 am but instead we will meet now at 2.30 pm at the same place. 	B
1142	I know that I 'm never going to forget this moment. 	B
1143	Although we are really happy with your new and, maybe, better job, we are really going to miss you. 	B
1144	She didn't know what was going to happen. 	B
1145	We were going to meet two days later in the square next to the centre. 	B
1146	I'm not going to be able to meet you next Tuesday, because I have to go to the dentist at 5.30. 	B
1147	I'm sure I'm not going to live in Kutná Hora forever. 	B
1148	We were going to get married two months ago but we broke up and I really didn't know why. 	B
1149	We were going to have a cup of coffee on Tuesday morning, do you remember? 	B
1150	I think you're going to like it. 	B
1151	And don't you think you are going to miss your parents? 	B
1152	I think I am going to enjoy that class. 	B
1153	I think that I am not going to sleep tonight because tomorrow is an exciting and interesting day. 	B
1154	As a matter of fact, apart from teenagers programmes and children's cartoons, there is not much to watch, and this is not going to teach you many things about life! 	B
1155	Fortunately, he was told his boss was going to be a bit late, so he had some time to go back home. 	B
1156	I was very worried but at the end he called me and told me he and his family were fine and that he was going to arrive tomorrow. 	B
1157	Mario Soares is already an old man, nearly 70, who is probably going to finish his active political life in 2 or 3 years. 	C
1158	As the new store is going to be the first and only one in Moscow, and, to make matters worse, it is going to be located close to our most successful outlet, it is undoubtedly going to have a detrimental effect on our company. 	C
1159	"Additionally, many British people stay at ""Tall Trees Campsite"", so I guess we would be forced to speak English all the time, which is also great because it is surely going to help us to improve our English skills. "	C
1160	But I don't know if I'm going to still live here. 	B
1161	First, I am going to briefly introduce the three main activities offered by the club. 	C
1162	Nobody is going to even look at you when your sister is there. 	C
1163	I'm working this Saturday and Sunday morning. 	A
1164	We are having the meal at 7pm. 	A
1165	They are going back on 20th July. 	A
1166	 Are you coming? 	A
1167	 It starts at 6. When are you coming? 	A
1168	 Where are you going? 	A
1169	I’m attending my grandmother’s funeral tomorrow. 	B
1170	We’re expecting a child very soon. 	B
1171	The movie is starting at 8 o’clock. 	B
1172	Are you visiting my country on your next holiday? 	B
1173	Why are you moving to a different area? 	B
1174	We’re throwing a party for fun on 5th January. 	B
1175	She is joining the course on Friday. 	B
1176	So are you planning to visit Japan then? 	B
1177	When is the festival starting and when is it finishing? 	B
1178	What kind of seminar materials are you providing? 	B
1179	I'll tell you more when I meet you. 	A
1180	Can you, please, call me when you find it? 	A
1181	I hope you enjoy your holiday too. 	A
1182	I hope you come to visit me soon. 	A
1183	 It begins on 8 o'clock in the evening. 	A
1184	The class is on Monday.  It starts at 6:00 pm and finishes at 7:00 pm. 	A
1185	I'm planning to move as soon as I finish college because job opportunities in my area aren't good. 	B
1186	I will let you know as soon as I get the exact date. 	B
1187	 by the time he gets home, he will just want to go straight to bed. 	C
1188	By the time you arrive the information office at the airport will be closed, as at 11.00 o'clock a full day strike will start. 	C
1189	We would suggest that our management takes a closer look. 	C
1190	"I recommend that we go to the theatre in Ginza where ""Miss Saigon"" is on. "	C
1191	Moreover, we insist that the agreement between you is legally binding . 	C
1192	Only when we understand that, will we be able to live in better societies. 	C
1193	Moreover, I think that only when people manage this will they be able to move on with their lives and offer something new to humanity. 	C
1194	And, sadly, I also believe that only when something really catastrophic happens will citizens face reality and accept that measures must be taken. 	C
1195	I'm sure I can beat you at chess. 	A
1196	I am not sure what I want to do but I am sure we will find something to do. 	A
1197	I’m sure that you will love it. 	A
1198	It's important that you take breaks and don't work all the time. 	B
1199	It's important that you eat healthy food. 	B
1200	I think it's important that you analyze each point to decide what to do. 	B
1201	If it is possible I would like to pay by credit card. 	B
1202	If possible, please re-deliver the same goods right now. 	B
1203	I'm not free at 6 so I'd change it to 9 if it's possible. 	B
1204	If it's possible, could you send the cards to my office in London? 	B
1205	I would prefer the 15th of July if it is possible. 	B
1206	The opening hours are quite convenient but, if possible, I would like the pool to open a bit earlier - at 8.30 am, for example. 	B
1207	Our sales department staff are heavily involved in several international projects, so it is necessary to improve their foreign language skills. 	B
1208	But sometimes it's essential to do what your parents want you to do. 	B
1209	In the centre of town it is possible to do more activities after school. 	B
1210	 It was impossible to install the system. 	B
1211	If you have to choose between two schools, I think it's important for you to know what they’re like. 	B
1212	It's impossible for me to meet with you at six o'clock. 	B
1213	It is important for everyone to attend this meeting. 	B
1214	 It's essential for me to go because I think I can't study physics by myself. 	B
1215	It seems clear to me that swimming is good for the whole body. 	B
1216	It is obvious that some people prefer reading books. 	B
1217	It is possible that we can be educated by TV. 	B
1218	It seems obvious that it is not necessary. 	B
1219	It does not seem possible that we can live without any private life. 	B

1509	 We must do that again, don't you think?! 	B
1510	Rome is really fantastic and you must go there! 	B
1511	When I realized that he must have forgotten, I called him up. 	B
1512	We had lots of fun learning how to ski. It was pretty hard at the beginning. I must have fallen about fifty times. 	B
1513	Is it possible to use the prize next year or must I cancel my trip to India? 	B
1514	Finally, how much money must I bring with me? 	B
1515	To sum up, we must all act immediately because the existence of humanity may be in danger. 	B
1516	But there is one, just one thing we must never forget: we have to be authentic. 	B
1517	 In addition I must strongly recommend you add something about nightlife. 	B
1518	On the other hand you must admit that not all ready-made meals taste really good and often they are not as healthy as fresh ones. 	B
1519	However, I must admit that I completely agree with Chris and consider the mountain road too daring to try. 	B
1520	Of course, India must have changed a lot since Jules Verne wrote his book, but I think that its charm remains. 	B
1521	I must have looked awful because she asked me whether I was all right. 	B
1522	I must say that I'm most delighted to have you here with us, Mr. Saramago, and it's with enormous pleasure that my students will hear your words. 	B
1523	As I like music a lot I went to as many concerts as possible, and I must say that they were superb. 	B
1524	Is it possible to use the prize next year or must I cancel my trip to India? 	B
1525	Finally, how much money must I bring with me? 	B
1526	You must not hit them or punish them without good reason if you do not want them to become your worst enemy. 	B
1527	They must not write on the walls. 	B
1528	In school for example, you mustn't talk during lessons, and you have to be on time. 	B
1529	" 'Must have fallen out of a car, or somfin'"" This was his next thought. "	C
1530	Not only must you study really hard during university, but also keep studying afterwards. 	C
1531	"To sum up, my opinion is that education is sacred, necessary and useful to all of us and never must it be characterised as ""a waste of time"". "	C
1532	 Nor must we overlook the human qualities. 	C
1533	But I would like to stress that I was really happy that she found another husband, although she had three little children which must not have been easy for him. 	C
1534	Something I have missed on behalf of my father is a bit more tenderness, but again I am guessing it must not have been easy for him to be a post-wartime son of a widow. 	C
1535	It mustn't have been more than an hour after the first announcement of the captain that there was a second one. 	C
1536	There must certainly be other solutions to the problem of the need for space for new houses. 	C
1537	RECOMMENDATION In my opinion our town must clearly use this area to create a park and a playground for children. 	C
1538	I must completely disagree with this statement, since I believe that in all jobs or occupations only the good professionals are able to earn a lot of money. 	C
1539	You needn't worry about where we can stay. 	B
1540	  when I send an e-mail, I need not worry about the time. 	B
1541	You needn't go out jogging in the evening because you have already had your exercise. 	B
1542	I like summer so much because the weather is hot and we needn't wear a jacket. 	B
1543	 As for the music, you needn't worry about it. 	B
1544	You needn't have bought me anything! 	C
1545	However, you needn't have bothered so much. 	C
1546	Need you ask? 	C
1547	Lastly I would appreciate , as I am sure others would too, if the premises were cleaner. Need I say more? 	C
1548	Need I go on? 	C
1549	Need you work in this way? 	B
1550	I think you ought to go on holiday with both of them. 	B
1551	Oh, I'm sorry, my mum's calling and I ought to go. 	B
1552	Then, if you'd rather go with your friend, you ought to talk to your parents first, and tell them what you think about it. 	B
1553	I think that you ought to play tennis or football at the weekend. 	B
1554	Otherwise some students would not get as much specialised help as they ought to. 	B
1555	Furthermore, we ought to take care of our health by going on trips to not unpolluted places as often as possible. 	B
1556	Of course not all zoos are as good as they ought to be, but today we know so much about the different animals that they don't have to get bored in the zoo and we're able to provide them with the environment they prefer. 	B
1557	There shouldn't be any rubbish dumps, all the rubbish ought to be recycled. 	B
1558	The rooms were dirty, there was no room service and there ought to be a lift since the rooms were on the 4th floor. 	C
1559	 we came to the conclusion that there ought to be some changes to the club’s publicity. 	C
1560	I think there ought to be more excursions and guided tours. 	C
1561	Moreover, you really ought to ask for details about the timetable they've set for schooling hours, just to be sure that its fits the with way of studying you are accustomed to. 	C
1562	This is what almost everyone thinks, but we really ought to think a little bit more about it. 	C
1563	One really ought to know the interests, wishes and demands of the receiver. 	C
1564	Another point, which I think ought to have been better managed, was the boat trip on the Thames. 	C
1565	However, the expert that I have consulted claims that this kind of polluted water is the most common consequence when placing gas stations and the government ought to have known that. 	C
1566	We were taken by surprise, when we didn’t get a tour guide. We ought to have booked one! 	C
1567	 the fundamental function of accounting software is to record the numerous ordinary business activities, which may improve the efficiency of the company. Besides, it ought to provide useful information in decision-making. 	C
1568	You ought not to be hungry. 	C
1569	they will most certainly have a banquet that day... and you oughtn't miss it for the world! 	C
1570	Secondly, there ought not to be a division between rich and poor. 	C
1571	We ought not to forget that in the last twenty years the food industry has increased the number of chemicals used in its products. 	C
1572	And if not, ought we not to learn from the mistakes of the past? 	C
1573	We shall start tomorrow at 2 o'clock. 	A
1574	I shall be free on Sunday at 6 o'clock in the evening. 	A
1575	Shall we meet at half past 4 in front of my house? 	A
1576	What time shall I come? And what shall I bring to the party? 	A
1577	Shall I go and buy some cake and crackers? 	A
1578	The tickets cost €25. Shall I buy you one? 	A
1579	Tomorrow evening there is Laura Pausini's concert in Turin. Shall we go? 	A
1580	Shall we go to a Korean restaurant after the film? 	A
1581	I promise that I shall cover all the work and give it to you tomorrow. 	B
1582	Remember that we shall meet inside the bar. 	B
1583	I apologise for having to miss tomorrow's English class as my cousin's wedding will be taking place ... I shall be attending class the day after tomorrow. 	B
1584	What shall I buy for her wedding? 	B
1585	 I am really sorry but I have to travel to Argentina for health reasons. What shall I do with next week's work? 	B
1586	This way, students shall not die of boredom or feel that their stay was useless. 	C
1587	Secondly, supplier contracts shall not be omitted. 	C
1588	This is, as I mentioned in my letter, only in the event I shall not be able to pick you up at the airport. 	C
1589	We therefore need to insist that the agreement is binding and that the contract shall be fulfilled. 	C
1590	Nowadays people live longer than they did in the past, which is very nice and pleasant, but we must be careful because if things get out of hand,  we shall be doomed to live in complete chaos. 	C
1591	I have to inform you that if we do not receive a reply this time we shall take the matter to court. 	C
1592	As a result, our town shall have financial benefits, as people visiting the library will visit the city’s shops for their needs. 	C
1593	 we shall probably have several years more to live. 	C
1594	You should come at 6 o'clock. 	A
1595	Someday we should go there together. 	A
1596	We should buy 2 tickets. 	A
1597	You shouldn't miss it. 	A
1598	It is a new flat, so there shouldn't be any problems. 	A
1599	I think you should not wear your favourite clothes because they may get dirty. 	A
1600	Should I wear special clothes? 	A
1601	It's going to be in São Paulo. Should we go by plane? 	A
1602	It was only €70. It is pink. It looks very nice. My advice, you should buy this. 	A
1603	on Monday, you will have to stay in this class for six hours so you should bring something to eat because you will be hungry. 	A
1604	You should take some money, because the ticket costs £4.00. 	A
1605	I think we should meet at 2 pm, and my mother will take us there so don't worry. 	A
1606	I think you should meet me around 4 pm at my house. 	A
1607	You should bring your guitar. 	A
1608	When you come back, we should rent some movies, shouldn't we? 	B
1609	I think I should write about the history of our company, shouldn't I? 	B
1610	You should have been with us. 	B
1611	I knew I should have written before. 	B
1612	I have an appointment. I know I shouldn't have taken it during school time but I had no other choice. 	B
1613	British people should eat more vegetables and fruit and avoid fast food! 	B
1614	I think everyone should learn to cook, you never know when you need to cook. 	B
1615	 It should be a good day! 	B
1616	the weather is still warm, so we should be able to visit the beaches and go sightseeing in the evenings. 	B
1617	You should have heard the noise. 	B
1618	You should have seen my face, I was so happy. 	B
1619	You should have been there with me, I had a great time. 	B
1620	I opened the envelope and read the letter. He had written that he was sorry and that he should not have done it. 	B
1621	Thank you for the present you sent me, you shouldn't have! 	B
1622	Thank you for the money, you shouldn't have sent it. 	B
1623	Well, have you ever checked your blood pressure? I think you should. 	B
1624	John spent the rest of the day thinking about what he should do. in fact, he wanted to answer and meet her again, but he knew that he shouldn't. 	B
1625	Well, you should be bouncing up and down with joy 	B
1626	These are the reasons that I believe we should be reading books instead of watching television in our free time and I believe many people believe the same thinks as I do. 	B
1627	The computer systems should be working again once you restart them. 	B
1628	However, I think that the situation should be improving in the next 6 months, especially during the third quarter of the year. 	B
1629	 The groom should be waiting at the entrance for the bride. 	C
1630	Wild animals should be running free but I think that zoos today have an important role in keeping them alive. 	B
1631	Moreover if a car driver has drunk too many alcoholic drinks or is tired he shouldn't be driving. 	B
1632	If you should change your mind and prefer to take a taxi, you can do it outside the airport by calling this number: 3570. 	C
1633	If something should happen, call 112, the local alarm number. 	C
1634	Should you need any further information, don't hesitate to contact us. 	C
1635	Should you withhold any important information or documentation, this could stop any payment to you. 	C
1636	I used to share my room with my brother. 	B
1637	When I was a little girl, we used to be together all the time. 	B
1638	We didn't use to talk to each other. 	B
1639	But this year I've met lots of new people that I didn't used to talk to, like Monica and Nina. 	B
1640	When I was I child, I used to go to a small school and I enjoyed it very much. 	B
1641	and she used to come to my house and play computer games with me. 	B
1642	I didn't use to laugh much but since the day we met, I'm always happy. 	B
1643	She doesn't travel as much as she used to. 	B
1644	I must admit that they did sound quite a lot better than they used to. 	B
1645	 What did we use to eat? 	C
1646	She had gone out for a walk in the woods as she used to do every Sunday, with her diary in her hand and a pen in her pocket. 	C
1647	He divorced his wife, old flabby Nellie as she used to call her, and proposed to her. 	C
1648	She married a well-off man, and ended up being a housewife, doing piecework for peanuts, as she used to say. 	C
1649	I used to play until late in the evening, I used not to do my homework and I did not excel at school. 	C
1650	As a teenager I used not to be very sociable, I had few friends and none of them felt close. 	C
1651	I will be at your house at 7.30 because I have an appointment before. 	A
1652	I'll come to see you tomorrow morning. 	A
1653	I will bring some music to the dinner. 	A
1654	I'll see you tomorrow. 	A
1655	If I need a camera, I will use my mobile phone. 	A
1656	And if my mum can, she will fetch you. 	A
1657	If you can help me, I will be very happy. 	A
1658	Don't worry, you won't need anything apart from some pencils and your art book. 	A
1659	I hope it will not be boring! 	A
1660	Will you be at home? 	A
1661	I'm happy because I'll see you tomorrow, but what time will you be here? 	A
1662	Will you come by bus? 	A
1663	Will you come with any friends? 	A
1664	My mother will get us there, and she will bring us to my house after too. 	A
1665	Will you come with me? 	A
1666	Will you be able to visit some museums with me? 	A
1667	Mr Miller, the Sales Director, will visit us next Thursday. 	B
1668	I'm sorry, but I won't be able to attend your class tomorrow . 	B
1669	I think that in 20 years' time it will be bigger than it is, because my town is growing very fast. 	B
1670	All your life, you'll be able to look at your parents, but as soon as you finish your school, it'll be harder to meet your old friends. 	B
1671	But you're right, without much sport practice you'll soon put on weight, won't you? 	B
1672	Will you please send me his name, address and telephone number. 	B
1673	Will you please inform me about the exact payment. 	B
1674	Will you pay attention! 	B
1675	The abundance of ingredients required in any recipe will result normally in a spicy but nutritious dish, a dish that will usually contain some kind of sauce made of hot pepper, tomatoes, garlic and onion, some kind of meat and also some vegetables. 	C
1676	She will often knock on the door to see you. 	C
1677	Go to lots of beautiful places that you won't usually be able to go to with a car, such as riversides. 	C
1678	Indeed no one can imagine what children will do! 	C
1679	I'd like to invite you to dinner. 	A
1680	I would like to eat some Spanish food. 	A
1681	I would like to invite you to dinner in my house on Saturday at 7 30 pm. 	A
1682	Dear Neighbours, I would like to invite you to my home for dinner. 	A
1683	If possible, I'd like to come to see you on Tuesday afternoon. 	A
1684	I would like to eat chicken, potatoes and some vegetables. 	A
1685	I'd love to have a pen-friend in Japan. 	A
1686	 I would prefer Sunday afternoon. 	A
1687	 You wouldn't believe how much they cost! 	A
1688	I think we would not need much money. 	A
1689	Sarah, would you like to play tennis this evening? 	A
1690	I'm going to a concert on Saturday. Would you like to go with me? 	A
1691	I want to watch the film, would you like to come with me? 	A
1692	I was thinking of painting my bedroom blue. It would look awesome. 	A
1693	It would be fun there. 	A
1694	 It would be very good if you came with me. 	A
1695	It would be nice to bring your new computer game and some clothes. 	A
1696	It would be perfect if you arrived at 7.20. 	A
1697	I would prefer to go on Sunday, because on Sunday I have no school. 	A
1698	 I'd prefer to see it tomorrow. 	A
1699	Bring your new CD! I'd love to hear it! 	A
1700	It's your decision but if I had the chance, I would go with my friends. 	B
1701	If you decided to go to the country school, you'd probably have more attention as a student. 	B
1702	If I were you, I would not watch TV all the time. 	B
1703	If I were able to move, I wouldn't move because I think this street is perfect.  	B
1704	I did not think my friend Janis would have done that. 	B
1705	That answer would have changed my life. 	B
1706	Without your help, I wouldn't have got this result. 	B
1707	Had it not been for that day, she would not have met George. 	B
1708	Would you let me know what you think? 	B
1709	Would you please do me a favour? Could you go and collect the clothes for me? 	B
1710	Think of the fun you will have with your friends, the whole day hanging around, playing sports, eating ice cream. Wouldn't that be wonderful? 	B
1711	I think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it? 	B
1712	I hope you will come soon, and I think that you would really enjoy it because is something different of what you are used to. 	B
1713	More over in my opinion it would probably be the best idea to choose the biggest school ... 	B
1714	I would definitely choose to live by the sea side! 	B
1715	I've just bought a new dress, and a beautiful black T-shirt. When I saw them, I thought they would be great for tonight's party. 	B
1716	 we thought that the film would be horrible because of the title but when the film started, the story was beautiful and Mauricio and I liked it a lot. 	B
1717	And she asked me if I would play the game with her against her cousin and her friend on Saturday. 	B
1718	The next week I would have flown to Miami to meet George Clooney. 	B
1719	If I were in your shoes I would have chosen the school which is in the centre of town  	B
1720	If you hadn't helped me, I wouldn't have known how to do that homework project. 	B
1721	If I had gone with uncomfortable shoes, I wouldn't have danced all the time. 	B
1722	I'd advise you to go with your friends because I bet you'll have so much fun! 	B
1723	If you want my opinion, I'd recommend the countryside because I think that the city in my country is very noisy. 	B
1724	Finally, I'd say that you should talk with your parents and your friends to decide. 	B
1725	If you have decided to move, I would say that it is better for you to choose the large school in the centre of the town. 	B
1726	Would you tell me about your room in your next letter, please? 	B
1727	Would it be possible for you to meet me later that day, around 7? 	B
1728	I had forgotten I have an appointment with my dentist at that time, so, would you mind if we met at 5 o'clock instead of meeting at 4 o'clock? 	B
1729	We are supposed to have a barbecue for lunch, would you mind bringing a salad? 	B
1730	She accepted the invitation and she said that she would come on the 21st of June. 	B
1731	I felt better when he said that he would be in Fenerbahce. 	B
1732	He told me I would like it and he was right! 	B
1733	We had to leave without you because the bus driver wouldn't wait. 	B
1734	It was all that I wanted in life but my parents would not allow me to buy it. 	B
1735	In my opinion I worked very hard. I would spend a lot of hours at work. 	B
1736	At night they would go to the rocky seaside and light a fire in order to deceive the boats and let them crash on the rocks. 	B
1737	Considering the aspects of our education system, and the results of my research, I would strongly recommend the following changes to be made. 	C
1738	Because of her wide and excellent experience with small children I believe that Nascha would easily fit into a family with small children. 	C
1739	I believe that the construction of such a centre would undoubtedly contribute to the improvement of our quality of life. 	C
1740	Organising family-oriented activities would significantly increase membership and raise the society's popularity with the local community. 	C
1741	It is probably in the sitting room on the table. 	A
1742	You should probably wear a T-shirt and shorts, with sneakers. 	A
1743	 It's definitely going to get messy. 	A
1744	I think I left my phone there, maybe in your kitchen. 	A
1745	Maybe we could visit that park you told me about or play at your house. 	A
1746	I want to buy new trousers and, perhaps, a T-shirt. 	A
1747	There you can dance, eat, drink and meet new friends 	A
1748	Perhaps it's in the kitchen under the table. 	A
1749	If I were you I'd certainly choose not to go with your parents. 	B
1750	I will certainly ring you on Friday. 	B
1751	Well, with the job you’ve got, you obviously can't keep fit. 	B
1752	For these reasons, I definitely recommend staying in a city. 	B
1753	Next year you can surely go somewhere with your friends. 	B
1754	You should probably bring sun block, because it's going be hot, and some food of course. 	B
1755	In my opinion if you decided to go to a large school in the centre of town, you would certainly meet a lot of cool people and you'd probably find it great. 	B
1756	Could I possibly see you at 3.30? 	B
1757	Could you possibly recommend what action should be taken? 	B
1758	As a conclusion, I want to say that while what we wear doesn't necessarily define who we are, it does play a big part in it. 	C
1759	This is not necessarily the way the older generation would see it though. 	C
1760	Presents. Strips, bows, paper-wrapping. Thinking of Christmas? Not necessarily. 	C
1761	Do I agree with this statement? Definitely. 	C
1762	There is also a park near my house. 	A
1763	My husband is a teacher. 	A
1764	That's why I like this place. 	A
1765	I go to college every day. 	A
1766	Martin is my best friend. 	A
1767	We have a big garden and a small swimming pool. 	A
1768	Her favourite colours are blue and black. 	A
1769	I have new neighbours. 	A
1770	They're nice people. 	A
1771	This place has nice shops. 	A
1772	I like reading interesting books in the Library. 	A
1773	Every Friday I go swimming and play computer games. 	A
1774	I am having a dinner party on Friday 25 December at 7 pm. 	A
1775	Can you come to my house on Friday evening? 	A
1776	My girlfriend likes vegetable pasta with tomato sauce, because she is vegetarian. 	A
1777	The food was delicious and the music was great. 	A
1778	The weather was so cold. 	A
1779	I phoned for more information two days ago. 	A
1780	 It is very important because I need to do some homework in it. 	A
1781	There are so many shops, you can play games, eat food like Chinese food. 	A
1782	I had so much fun! 	A
1783	I spent too much money, five hundred euros, but I don’t mind because they are beautiful! 	A
1784	I visited a lot of museums and I went shopping. 	A
1785	All of our classmates were there and some of my cousins too. 	A
1786	I bought a beautiful pink skirt and a white top. 	A
1787	Lysiane is taller than me and she has short black hair. 	A
1788	It is a beautiful old city and there is the old wall around the city. 	A
1789	I left my small white bag. 	A
1790	Don't forget to wear old, comfortable clothes. 	A
1791	She's in a volleyball team like me, but we're not in the same one. She was for the other team, which lost. 	A
1792	You can always visit our Shopping Centre, which is one of the biggest in Brazil. 	A
1793	The mobile phone which I bought yesterday is brilliant. 	A
1794	The person who gave me it was my father. 	A
1795	The last day when we can see the movie is Thursday. 	A
1796	I want to invite you to a pop concert that is going to take place in the National Stadium. 	A
1797	The music that I like is Rock &amp; Roll. 	A
1798	It's my sister's jacket. 	A
1799	I bought a red tie because next Sunday it will be my father's birthday. 	A

2087	I was just watching a football match. 	A
2088	 I was always dreaming about it. 	A
2089	Yesterday we were studying maths in your house, and I left my book on your bed. 	A
2090	It was raining when I arrived. 	A
2091	I went to a soccer game, they were playing the last game to get the championship. 	A
2092	It was raining, but the concert was so good that I did not mind. 	A
2093	He was not planning to become a professional player. 	C
2094	She was not feeling very well. 	B
2095	I tried to phone her house, but her phone wasn't working. 	B
2096	I'm writing you this letter to tell you that we felt so bad when we heard you weren't working at the school any more. 	B
2097	Was my mother going to die? 	B
2098	I couldnt see anybody, then there he was, my hero, my favorite singer Bob Dylan saying my name, but was he calling me? 	B
2099	What were you doing? 	B
2100	 Everything was strange. Why was I following a green fox? 	B
2101	He was still waiting at the traffic light. 	B
2102	He was actually acting like a ghost. 	B
2103	Because she was sitting in the corner, she could see the whole view of the café in front of her. 	B
2104	Yesterday a TV company came to my school because they were doing a science quiz. 	B
2105	Worst of all, in September it was always raining. 	B
2106	He was always talking about this prize but I never thought he would win it. 	B
2107	My younger brother was constantly bothering me. 	B
2108	One day, as she was wistfully walking in the dusk of that day, she told herself she could either go on living her lonely life or make a huge effort to fit in. 	B
2109	I was wondering if I could impose on you again for my next visit. 	B
2110	I was thinking that you could wear your Marilyn Monroe dress as your fancy-dress costume. 	B
2111	I was thinking that you could come to my house and see the movie. 	B
2112	They had been told that I was always getting into mischief and so had decided that, by buying me this diary, I would probably calm down a little and my behaviour would change. 	C
2113	I was constantly trying to balance my school life, extra-curricular activities, studies and personal life and was always running out of time. 	C
2114	I had been working on the project for over a year. 	B
2115	We had been waiting for hours. 	B
2116	I didn't need so much, because I'd been saving money for a few months. 	B
2117	I had been waiting for this letter for months, so I opened it immediately. 	B
2118	Once I had been watching TV for 6 hours when my Mum suddenly switched it off. 	B
2119	I know it very well because we had been exchanging letters for a long time. 	B
2120	She had been going there since she was ten years old. 	B
2121	He began to think about his own thoughts while he was smoking a cigarette 	B
2122	And there were two men who had been chasing the murderer to find out who the man is and rescue the girl.... 	B
2123	The guide also tells some funny stories about an old lord, who had been living there in the 18th century. 	B
2124	After a few minutes the door was opened and the man who  had been following me came in. 	B
2125	"After we had been sunbathing at the beach all day long, we went every evening to a cosy restaurant called ""The Barking Cat"", where we had a good meal and some wine. "	B
2126	After I had been waiting for an hour, I decided to go through the gate and go in on foot. 	B
2127	Laura realised that she had not been studying very hard lately. 	B
2128	I couldn't tell her about Mark because she hadn't been doing anything else but talking about him for the last three weeks. 	B
2129	Last week, two of your employers came to solve the problems of my central heating system as it had not been working for two days. 	B
2130	I had been working hard at my job and I had really been looking forward to this holiday. 	B
2131	When he died, he was a rich man, he had only been living ten months in the house he had built for fourteen years ? 	B
2132	Unfortunately it had been snowing for a long time and so I was unable to go out for a walk. 	B
2133	We had been working very hard all the morning so by that time, I was very tired. 	B
2134	What had he been doing that morning? 	C
2135	So, why had she been waiting for so long a time? 	C
2136	If the weather had been better, we would have enjoyed it more. 	B
2137	If you had gone there with me, you would have been happy. 	B
2138	So I decided to go back and look for them in the park: believe it or not I would have spent all night in the park, if it hadn't been closed since six o'clock! 	B
2139	I felt really sorry for you after I had read your last letter. 	B
2140	 I'd forgotten that I have an appointment with the doctor  	B
2141	The ABC Company called this morning to say that our company had not delivered the goods on time. 	B
2142	I hadn't heard from her for two months. 	B
2143	It was the most beautiful one I had ever seen. 	B
2144	So, she came to America to see a relation she had never seen before, and she spent the money with me. 	B
2145	I had just arrived from school when I saw the letter. 	B
2146	I had always wanted to visit European cities and Paris was one of the easiest cities to get to from England. 	B
2147	He then thought how stupid he had been. 	B
2148	Actually I'd arranged an appointment with my doctor before calling you. 	B
2149	He was sleeping but I realised that this was because he had lost a lot of blood. 	B
2150	I was driving on to my parents' house because I had arranged to have dinner with them. 	B
2151	If only I had listened to my father! 	B
2152	If only I had met her before. 	B
2153	"I am sure, because at the end of the concert, I said to my friend ""I wish they had played a bit more"". "	B
2154	I wish I hadn't told Pat about my plans. 	B
2155	I wish I hadn't done that but now I can't do anything. 	B
2156	Never had I been in such a ridiculous situation! 	B
2157	Never before had we seen such marvellous species of fish. 	B
2158	...but no sooner had I gone to bed than someone broke the door down. 	B
2159	But, no sooner had I got there than my classmates informed me that I had done well in my physics exam. 	B
2160	But now she felt stronger and had lost her fear. 	B
2161	Simon was a very famous writer and had written ten best-sellers. 	B
2162	All her friends from Chicago had come to visit her and had brought a huge chocolate cake with them. 	B
2163	They were cold and had gone numb. 	B
2164	Had I made the same mistake twice? 	B
2165	? the question was: Why had he done that? 	B
2166	He had finally achieved his goal! 	B
2167	She had suddenly woken up at that noise, but now was trying to persuade herself it was just a dream. 	B
2168	And had all the furniture and David's personal things been stolen by thieves or had they just simply disappeared? 	B
2169	After a while Mr and Mrs Landsbury, the couple who had organised the party, got everybody's attention and  asked everybody to stay calm. 	B
2170	He went to the hotel because he wanted to find out who the person was that had sent him a mysterious letter? 	B
2171	 it was Annika who had arranged a huge party for her, and all her friends and family, at the airport. 	B
2172	After the show we had planned to go to the theatre restaurant. But it was closed. 	B
2173	We had planned to go to Switzerland, but unfortunately our car broke down. 	B
2174	At first she had wanted to make the first move but she wasn't quite convinced. 	B
2175	I asked him who had given him my phone number and he said it had been me. 	B
2176	He didn't find her, in spite of looking for her in every room of her house, so he decided to come to my house to ask me if I had seen her somewhere. 	B
2177	I asked her what had happened and she told me that my grandmother was very ill. 	B
2178	 one morning she was listening to the radio, when suddenly the announcer said that the police had arrested a man who had stolen five expensive and unique paintings. 	B
2179	She tried to explain what had happened, but she couldn't. 	B
2180	I looked at the address and I knew what had happened to my sister's postcard. 	B
2181	Had I known the tour would be so bad, I wouldn't have booked it. 	C
2182	Had they been new people, travellers from other countries, I could have taken it, but all the customers were English! 	C
2183	Sometimes I think that had I gone to Britain without this experience, my life would have been different. 	C
2184	If only she had not changed, if only I had helped her, maybe we would still be best friends and I would not be sitting here, writing about her! 	C
2185	If only I hadn't been that rude! 	C
2186	Had it not been for the fact that I had already read the article, I would have thought that this woman was at least thirty years old. 	C
2187	Another aspect of his emotional side is the fact that he is a very private person, and had it not been for this feature, he might have been able to react differently. 	C
2188	If it hadn't been for my lack of knowledge, skills, experience, and some other things like that, I wouldn't have been fired. 	C
2189	They had become very good friends and their friendship could have gone a little further if it hadn't been for Dan's character. 	C
2190	Hardly had she spoken these words when it dawned on the musician that life could not continue like that. 	C
2191	Hardly had he taken them from the counter when the monster vanished again. 	C
2192	Every day at college I went to class at 9 am. 	A
2193	I met her about ten years ago. 	A
2194	My grandmother lived in a village and I often went there. 	A
2195	The people were very polite. 	A
2196	Every time I went to Hendon Park, I saw so many people there. 	A
2197	I liked this place very much. 	A
2198	I forgot to tell you some details about tomorrow evening. 	A
2199	I spent about £35 on all those clothes. 	A
2200	 I liked it very much because my favourite team won, it was great. 	A
2201	The player from China did not look very happy though. 	A
2202	You did not keep your promise. 	A
2203	I didn't tell you that my house is opposite the new cinema. 	A
2204	They didn't cost much ... 	A
2205	I was surprised because the heating didn't work. 	A
2206	Did you buy something yesterday? 	A
2207	 Did you find it? 	A
2208	And when did you go shopping last? 	A
2209	When I arrived, the weather was horrible. 	A
2210	 I think I left it in the kitchen when I fell on the slippery floor. 	A
2211	I convinced some of my friends to come with me even if they don't like rap music. 	B
2212	Previously I faced many failures but I never gave up. 	B
2213	The cameraman filmed us during a lesson and later, walking to the playground. 	B
2214	I didn't realise I had lost the ring till I was at home. 	B
2215	I didn't trust him. 	B
2216	we had one in the garage that we did not use. 	B
2217	Did you receive my present? 	B
2218	How did you spend your weekend? 	B
2219	Why didn't he call me? 	B
2220	We arranged to meet each other next Tuesday at 11 o'clock, didn't we? 	B
2221	Didn't you spend your last holiday with them as well? 	B
2222	he always seemed so confident to me! 	B
2223	we always talked during the class. 	B
2224	It would be better if you spent some time in the fresh air with your friends or walking in a park. 	B
2225	If you wanted to do some outdoor activities, we could go fishing or even walking through the green fields.	B
2226	I remember her as a shy girl, but I read she became a manager, she went on lots of trips, she met a lot of new friends, she got married and then she got divorced. 	B
2227	We met at 9 in the morning and decided to go to the seven lakes, a very wonderful place not far from the centre of the town: lots of trees, lots of flowers and very fresh air. 	B
2228	We waited for the suitcase for two days and then we bought new dresses. 	B
2229	I wish that you were here, cycling with us. 	B
2230	I wish you were here with me. I wish we were together. 	B
2231	I wish weekends lasted five days. 	B
2232	I didn't hesitate and went there straight away. 	B
2233	I'm sure it wasn't my fault as I didn't switch anything on or off at that moment. 	B
2234	? we really enjoyed our holiday even though things did not turn out they way we planned. 	B
2235	Are you still looking for a job or did you succeed in finding one? 	B
2236	When did you last see your wife and your children? 	B
2237	It was great to have met you, and we certainly had a terrific time together, didn't we? 	B
2238	Didn't you tell me that you had to go to Orleans today? 	B
2239	Why didn't you say something about it? 	B
2240	as soon as we went down to around 15 metres in depth, we saw a lot of coloured fish. 	B
2241	I told you about that terrible hotel I had stayed in before I came to visit you. 	B
2242	Once he got inside, he started searching for some clues to that horrible crime. 	B
2243	I also worked as a helper on a summer camp for primary schoolchildren in Canada last summer. 	B
2244	I can remember one which happened to me last year, during the Christmas holiday. 	B
2245	He worked hard for quite a long time to earn the money he needed. 	B
2246	I think it would be very helpful if I told you my own case. 	B
2247	It would be great if you sent me a free copy of the next edition of The Student Tourist Guidebook. 	B
2248	I would be grateful if you gave me this job. 	B
2249	So, I wondered if you could introduce me to somebody who knows how to use a camera, so that I will be able to record my trip for you. 	B
2250	I wanted to know if the rooms are single or double, if they have showers and if there is room service. B Secondly, I also wanted to know if there is a gym in the hotel ?  	B
2251	First of all, I wanted to thank you for giving me the first prize in your competition. 	B
2252	The companies I found at the trade fair were very varied. Not only did I find high-technology companies, but also shoemakers, advertisement companies and plane manufacturers to name but a few. 	C
2253	Not only didn't we travel 5000 miles in 30 days, as you had advertised, but also we stayed 8 days in just one place, which had nothing interesting to see except a church. 	C
2254	Not only didn't I learn any new grammar but also I couldn't enrich my vocabulary. 	C
2255	Did you spot the fact that what is expected from us in Tall Trees Campsite is to help in organising the entertainment? 	C
2256	How did it turn out then? 	C
2257	I told you about Peter and Mary, didn't I? 	C
2258	Didn't we all dream of being famous once in our lives? 	C
2259	Following advice from a friend, I purchased the English version of your product, only to find out its quality did not match the promises made in your advertisement. 	C
2260	After having discussed this subject with the other member, we came up with the following decisions. First of all ?  	C
2261	We did reach the target figure and we have sent about 85 percent of the money to the hospital. 	C
2262	 We did have 34 games and one stall with beverages and snacks. 	C
2263	"It is true that it did rain during the day but it was not a ""sudden downpour"",  as you wrote. It was more a small shower ?  "	C
2264	I understand you are quite concerned about the matter and I thought it would be a good idea to let you know what is really going on. 	C
2265	The reason why I'm writing to you is that I thought you might be interested in writing about a special dish from your country for the international cookbook. 	C
2266	I have been thinking about your letter. 	B
2267	We've been studying together since grade one. 	B
2268	The letter was from my brother, who has been living in New York since he graduated from university. 	B
2269	Have you been thinking about it a lot?! 	B

2278	I hope that I have not been wasting your time and giving you too much trouble. 	B
2279	Hope you haven't been working too hard! 	B
2280	The heating system has not been working properly since your staff completed the work in my house. 	B
2281	I have just been reading an article in your newspaper this morning, about The Westfield Music Festival. 	B
2282	I've also been singing in a choir for five years, so I'm very familiar with it. 	B
2283	You have already been complaining about headaches and insomia. 	B
2284	They might be slippery when it has been snowing. 	B
2285	Not only have I been wandering its streets ever since I was ten, but I have also come to know most of the main characters of its history in the past 50 years. 	C
2286	Not only have I been expecting it for the last few months but I will also give some support to my wife, who has been feeling a little nervous these last weeks. 	C
2287	I haven't eaten Italian food for a long time. 	A

2385	I'm going to put it right in front of the window, so I have enough light. 	B
2386	I felt I was flying and it was really like a dream. 	B
2387	But anyway it's enjoyable to shop for clothes  especially with a group of friends. 	B
2388	So this is the best festival I been to. 	B
2389	Please give him all the information he asks for. 	B
2390	Everybody should see which company I work for. 	B
2391	"She did not say very much except for ""oh"" and ""yes, yes"" every once in a while. "	B
2392	 And it gives them the possibility of gradually gaining knowledge about other living creatures apart from humans. 	B
2393	 It is based on my personal opinions in addition to a sample of 500 people who are students and staff at the school, and also visitors. 	B
2394	Now, as for the camping, I admit that I'm not a great fan of it. 	B
2395	I hope that, in spite of some small problems, people liked the festival and we will be able to attend it next year. 	B
2396	According to your advertisement in a language magazine, you have a vacancy in which I am very interested. 	B
2397	I hope that you can help me by answering some questions about the club of which you are the secretary. 	B
2398	In my opinion children need someone to whom they can talk. 	B
2399	Suddenly the lights went out and a kind of silent screaming was heard throughout the whole dark room. 	B
2400	So why don?t you act upon my advice? 	B
2401	I took bus number 19 from Angel tube station toward Battersea Park. 	B
2402	In Tottenham, transport is easy, buses are frequent, unlike other areas. 	B
2403	A survey was carried out amongst the students and teachers. 	B
2404	It's unbelievable that this civilization that lived a long time ago could be so ahead of their time. 	C
2405	I think that the next area to develop will be the car industry, which will develop cars that are going to work by solar energy, on account of the levels of pollution in big cities. 	C
2406	I am sending you some flowers, because you are not well. 	A
2407	I am writing to tell you what I do every day at college. 	A
2408	 We are missing you. 	A
2409	I am sending you these flowers because I think that you will like these pretty flowers and you will get well soon. 	A
2410	I really like it when we are doing more speaking. 	A
2411	 I?m not using it any more. 	A
2412	?the fridge isn't working. 	A
2413	? he's going to work at 5.00 am, so he's not eating anything ... 	A
2414	Dear Mom, How are you doing? 	A
2415	What are you bringing with you? 	A
2416	I'm always dreaming about a job as a secretary. 	A
2417	You are always losing things. 	A
2418	She is always smiling. 	A
2419	I am watching a swimming competition. 	A
2420	"I'm selling an English book. It's called ""English II"". "	A
2421	It's June and it's getting warmer. 	A
2422	 I'm living with my friend in Wolverhampton. I'm studying at Wolverhampton College. 	A
2423	My mother is working today so my older brother can bring us to the sports centre. 	A
2424	I'm doing a lot of great leisure activities. 	B
2425	 I'm playing this exciting game called Diner Dash; it's about making a restaurant. 	B
2426	I have to go to the doctor because I'm having some problems. 	B
2427	I?m planning a picnic on Saturday in the park. 	B
2428	I?m expecting my cousin to visit me. 	B
2429	I think I am falling in love. 	B
2430	I'm enjoying a sunny day, much better than England. 	B
2431	Now, I'm in a hotel, here in the centre of Madrid, and it's raining a little bit. 	B
2432	? scientists don't really get together with top models ? they are constantly studying and reading books, whereas the job of a top model is actually based on physical appearance. 	B
2433	? you're continuously dealing with toxic substances and flammable liquids? 	B
2434	 Are we becoming shallow? 	C
2435	Why is technology taking over our lives? 	C
2436	Why am I explaining all this? The only reason is that I want to show that young people are interested in sports. 	C
2437	? we are persistently asking ourselves questions about where we are from and why we are here. 	C
2438	During life we are permanently learning and increasing our knowledge. 	C
2439	Considering the importance of the matter, I am asking for your financial support. 	C
2440	I'm asking permission to be excused from work for at least three days. 	C
2441	If we're wanting to make progress in prolonging the length of human lives, we equally have to be willing to spend time and make an effort... 	C
2442	Every day at college I learn new words and new things. 	A
2443	I am your new neighbour. 	A
2444	She plays tennis and she likes going to the swimming pool. 	A
2445	I don't like meat and fish. 	A
2446	You don?t know the place. 	A
2447	I really like my kitchen, because it is big and new and it makes my cooking easy. 	A
2448	I really want to see you. 	A
2449	I work in a supermarket. 	A
2450	I like my place because it is quiet, the people are nice, it is near the town centre, not too far from the college and my flat is lovely. 	A
2451	It takes 25 minutes by car, but by bus it takes 1 hour ? 	A
2452	I watch TV in the evening. I read books at night. 	A
2453	She goes to work by bus. 	A
2454	If you want some help, I will be free next week. 	A
2455	If you go with your parents, you will go walking or swimming, but if you go with friends, you will have more fun. 	A
2456	Don't forget to wear colourful clothes because if you wear white clothes, you will get paint on them. 	A
2457	 It is very important for me because if I don't have it, I can't clean my teeth. 	A
2458	They are very important to me, because they bring me good luck. 	A
2459	I hope you can come next time. 	A
2460	 The journey takes about half an hour from Paris. 	A
2461	Do you know how to get to my house? 	A
2462	Do you know which present I like best? 	A
2463	I don't need the video because I've got the DVD. 	A
2464	You don't bring anything because it's the first day. 	A
2465	It doesn't cost very much. 	A
2466	Do you have a mobile phone? 	A
2467	Do you know we are going to have a concert at school?	A
2468	What do you think about my mobile phone? 	A
2469	Who do you want to come to the concert? 	A
2470	People usually try to eat their breakfast between 7 and 9 am. 	A
2471	They always make special things for their celebrations. 	A
2472	Then you turn right and my house is on your left. 	A
2473	"To find my house you have to leave the bus at the station ""Unberhof"" Then you go straight on for about fifty meters. "	A
2474	Then you walk for a few minutes See you tomorrow. 	A
2475	I think my bag is in your kitchen. 	A
2476	I hope that you feel better. 	A
2477	Do you know  that I am going to a concert on Saturday. 	A
2478	Why don't you wear your black suit? 	A
2479	Why don't we go to a disco when the film ends? 	A
2480	We could have dinner after that if you want. 	A
2481	We can go there, if you like. 	A
2482	It's a bit strange, don't you think? 	B
2483	I think it?s the best way, don?t you agree? 	B
2484	The surprise will be even bigger if I wait. Don't you think so? 	B
2485	Does your brother go with your parents? 	B
2486	Which programmes do we like to watch? 	B
2487	Where do they want to spend their holidays? 	B
2488	How does he know my name? 	B
2489	I'm reading an adventure book, I don't remember the title but it's very boring! 	B
2490	Well, I totally understand that you want to go somewhere with your friends. 	B
2491	For example, I know a person that moved to my city two years ago, and now he says that it improved his social life. 	B
2492	The movie shows how a pretty woman with all the problems you can imagine can do different things to make people feel better. 	B
2493	I suggest that if you travel, you should pay for your trip. 	B
2494	I apologise for missing your class. 	B
2495	For these reasons, I definitely recommend staying in a city. 	B
2496	Not only do they save you filing time, but also they save office space. 	B
2497	Not only does it look nice but it's also full of places that we should visit, such as the enormous old castle or the extremely fascinating butterfly farm!! 	B
2498	We disagree with the new numbering system as it is too complicated. 	B
2499	I'd love to go to the concert with you so I accept your invitation. 	B
2500	I advise you to take a coat because it's winter, you know, it's a bit cold. 	B
2501	The plot of the book takes place in Vienna after the Second World War. 	B
2502	The scene takes place on a train. ? On this train, a man is sleeping. He dreams. He dreams of one of his work colleagues who lost his job last year. 	B
2503	Don't you just hate taking the bus to school every morning? well I have a perfect solution for you, a great bike with good brakes, a bell and lights. it is a great bike but since I never use it I would be happy to sell it to you. 	C
2504	Don't you find that when you are having a shower or bath, you occasionally run out of water? 	C
2505	Doesn?t it sound fascinating? 	C
2506	Don't we all like presents? 	C
2507	Don't you think that fashion always looks funny if it is not the fashion of today? 	C
2508	The popularity of this TV game in Russia clearly demonstrates the nature of human fears and dreams. 	C
2509	The 2 charts illustrate the number of employees, and the trends in profit for three factories, namely the factories located in London, Leeds, and Bristol, which belong to the same company, during the year 2003. 	C
2510	A friend of mine gave me a present for my birthday. 	A
2511	Some friends of mine were here with me too. 	A
2512	I bought a new jacket because mine was very old. 	A
2513	I bought a pullover and trousers because mine are too small for me. 	A
2514	The phone is not mine. 	A
2515	You should bring your computer games and Maths book. I have lost mine. 	A
2516	I want to give you a birthday present like mine. 	A
2517	It was my best present, although I also loved yours. 	A
2518	My favourite meal is spaghetti with garlic bread. What's yours? 	A
2519	To go to my house from yours, take the first on the right, Victoria Road, and there is an underground station. 	A
2520	I bought a pink mobile. It's like yours. 	A
2521	So that's all about my mobile phone. Please write to me about yours too! 	A
2522	Maybe you can take a friend of yours with you there. 	B
2523	I think that it's a very good idea of yours to come to the UK.	B
2524	You can ask some friends of yours to join you. 	B
2525	Hope you have a friend as good as mine! 	B
2526	My bedroom is not as big as yours but it is lovely. 	B
2527	My town isn't very big, so I think it won't grow as fast as yours. 	B
2528	I hope  my English becomes as good as yours. 	B
2529	We bought it because yours is very old and sometimes stops working. 	B
2530	I really needed some extra information, and yours was very useful. 	B
2531	Finally we went to Venice where we met some friends of ours and spent with them the rest of the holiday. 	B
2532	The credit crunch is heavily affecting this region, therefore all retail sales have fallen and many competitors of ours are decreasing their sales too. 	B
2533	Paul, a classmate of ours, will be the D.J. and we are thinking of listening to rock music, since Mr. Brown likes it. 	B
2534	I told my mother that your Spanish omelette is better than hers. 	B
2535	Lots of changes which may occur during the next fifty years can make us fear that our sons' and grandsons' lives will not be as happy as ours. 	B
2536	At the entrance, the security guard asked for my identity card. Pat gave hers. 	B
2537	She didn't remember leaving it there, it wasn't even hers, which is what frightened her the most. 	B
2538	But when she gave this suitcase a good look, she realised that it wasn't hers. 	B
2539	She saw him on a train running parallel to hers. 	B
2540	Can we rent windsurf boards or should we bring ours with us? 	B
2541	 ? when we read about them we think that we are the characters and we live their stories as if they were ours. 	B
2542	Aldous Huxley was able to create a new world which is not so different from ours. 	B
2543	 This road shouldn't be allowed in the middle of a small town like ours. 	B
2544	Ours is the only store in this locality which opens at 7.00 am. 	B
2545	Ours is a retail company with 5 outlets, dealing in furnishings. 	B
2546	In order to persuade them, we would like to show comparisons between our products and the ones from other companies to demonstrate that ours are more effective and efficient. 	B
2547	I could show them the traditional things of our country and learn theirs. 	B
2548	She told him that this baby was theirs. 	B
2549	Red Stone are a very big group, you know that I'm a great fan of theirs. 	B
2550	I realise that it can be a very interesting experience and I can also improve my foreign language as well as theirs. 	B
2551	I hope that other councils will consider improving the cyclists' cycling conditions as ours did. 	C
2552	Yes, of course there are much larger gardens in this area, but ours is more than four times as big as the one we had in Holland. 	C
2553	What is more, the manager organises excursions to London. Ours was breathtaking. We visited unbelievably interesting museums? 	C
2554	I could just imagine it, meeting her at her house, her mother asking me to take care of her between puffs of smoke and coughing fits in that hoarse voice of hers. 	C
2555	I kept silent when I was introduced to that new girlfriend of his. 	C
2556	You can park that precious jeep of yours. 	C
2557	I've been looking all over for that bright great-nephew of mine. 	C
2558	I put Sophie's pictures in my bag because hers was already packed. 	C
2559	 I also recall my father saying to my mother that hers was not as good as my grandmother's. 	C
2560	She thought, as she sometimes did, that hers was a drab existence, but that she could do hardly anything to avoid it. 	C
2561	Therefore, his was not a happy and normal childhood. 	C
2562	He was my confidant and I was his. 	C
2563	It was as if she had completely forgotten about the outlines of his face, his hair, all the features that were his. 	C
2564	Bob attracts many of his students to the teaching career, which is rather looked down on in a developing poor country like his. 	C
2565	I was a great admirer of hers. 	C
2566	She asked some old friends of hers and she went to the church where the marriage was taking place. 	C
2567	My parents invited the father of a friend of theirs who spoke French. 	C
2568	Then he showed me a very old diary of his, just for me to have an idea of what to do. 	C
2569	He was able to build a very successful business which allowed him and his family to live very well and to travel 	C
2570	Theirs is a relationship between two members of the privileged classes, who really don't care about the world around 	C
2571	Theirs had always been a love-and-hate relationship. 	C
2572	Yet, beautiful dreams never last long, and theirs lasted until she had to leave England. 	C
2573	When comparing the value and achievements of athletes with doctors or scientists, theirs begin to lack in significance. 	C
2574	I enjoyed myself so much. 	A
2575	I bought myself a yellow T-shirt with nothing on it. 	A
2576	I hope you'll enjoy yourself . 	A
2577	I will ask my friends from the class and I will study by myself. 	B
2578	You can do some exercise by yourself. 	B
2579	He tried to open it by himself. 	B
2580	She decided to find him by herself. 	B
2581	I decided to talk to him and introduce myself. 	B
2582	First you should ask yourself if you have enough money for the journey. 	B
2583	Lisa told herself to be strong and hoped everything would be alright. 	B
2584	I was really surprised when I read the e-mail. It was from someone who calls himself  the black shadow. 	B
2585	He told me about himself and how he started playing the guitar. 	B
2586	Now she was very proud of herself. 	B
2587	The best solution will be if you decide yourself what to do. 	B
2588	I think it was the director himself who guided the actress through our wonderful school gardens to film the opening scene there. 	B
2589	The food was delicious, especially the cake, which Sandra had cooked herself. 	B
2590	A friend of mine and I are planning to spend a short holiday by ourselves. 	B
2591	There are many things to say, but I think that you will find these by yourselves. 	B
2592	Then suddenly, the lights started clicking on and off, the windows opened by themselves. 	B
2593	If an animal is kept by itself , with no one to keep it company, it will get lonely and very sad. 	B
2594	Suddenly, the window opened by itself and the room filled with cold air. 	B
2595	Doing sports is an excellent way to relax and it can help us to feel good about ourselves. 	B
2596	The staff didn't have enough time for themselves. 	B
2597	In this way we will be able to enjoy ourselves even if this is not well-paid work. 	B
2598	In the afternoons, you'll be able to visit the archaeological sites and in the evening you can entertain yourselves by dancing or listening to music in our city clubs. 	B
2599	But adults often ask themselves the question - isn't it cruel to keep animals in zoos? 	B
2600	I would also spend much more quality time with my family as a whole, which is quite important in itself. 	B
2601	The architecture in itself is beautiful, but the garden is very wonderful, too. 	B
2602	To begin with, a car, in my opinion, can't be harmful in itself. The trouble is that, nowadays, very fast cars are put on the market and we never know if they are going to be driven by wise people or, instead, by crazy or dreadful drivers. 	B
2603	In my opinion, the main characters do not have to be liked by readers but the story itself must be good and interesting to be successful. 	B
2604	The building itself looks splendid and beautiful. 	B
2605	The food is not very good, but sometimes we can prepare something to eat ourselves. 	B
2606	They patiently explained to me my job even though they were fairly busy themselves. 	B
2607	Cars themselves are never dangerous. It depends on us, actually. 	B
2608	"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to you in response to the advertisement published by yourselves in ""the Traveller"" regarding The Trip of a Lifetime. "	B
2609	The question you asked droves me back to my early life. My childhood. Like yourselves I am also living in a busy town, in a busy street. But when I was a little kid I was with my grand parents in Kandy. 	B
2610	Also, it is a great opportunity to improve my sailing skills as training will be provided by yourselves. 	B
2611	As for myself, as you can clearly see from my account of this musical event, music still means an awful lot to me, and most probably allways will. 	C
2612	 As for myself I like taking responsibilities. 	C
2613	" As for myself, I grew up during the ""internet era"", the years when it was spreading to average peoples homes and therefore I can still remember life without it. "	C
2614	The maths is boring and I don't like it. 	A
2615	If you can't find it, call me. 	A
2616	Do you like it too? 	A
2617	I'm very happy that you want to see me. 	A
2618	I can see her on Saturday at 8 pm. 	A
2619	It protects us from rain, wind and sun. 	A
2620	You will find a lot of different shops ? I hope you'll like them. 	A
2621	I really like to learn new words. It's very important for me. 	A
2622	Sometimes I go with her. 	A
2623	Can you bring some music so we can listen to it. 	A
2624	I spend my free time with them. 	A
2625	Hello Mrs Bishop. It's Clarisse 	A
2626	Dear Cris, it's me, Paarth. 	A
2627	Can I help you? 	A
2628	What do you think about that? 	A
2629	Can we have a chat? 	A
2630	Hi, Mrs. Bishop. How are you? 	A
2631	Is it OK? 	A
2632	In my free time I go shopping and I like swimming. 	A
2633	If you want, you can go inside. 	A
2634	He prefers chess. 	A
2635	My friend's name is Julissa, she is from Ecuador and she lives near my home. 	A
2636	I like my home because it is a beautiful home. It has a big garden and a good sitting room. 	A
2637	I like my front garden because it's very nice and warm. 	A
2638	They're nice people. 	A
2639	Hope to see you soon. 	A
2640	Hi! How are you? Hope you are fine. 	A
2641	It's warm and windy. 	A
2642	Now it 's 3 pm. 	B
2643	It is best to spend your time in the countryside. 	B
2644	It's boring to be at home when you have a lot of free time. 	B
2645	It's normal that your parents want you to go with them. 	B
2646	This shyness makes it hard for me to speak in public, or even to go out with my friends as often as I should. 	B
2647	Other retail companies with cheaper prices and lots of discounts make it impossible for us to do business. 	B
2648	Must rush now because I have to go out with Paul. 	B
2649	Sounds great. 	B
2650	Got to go now. 	B
2651	Can't wait to hear about your exam. 	B
2652	When you watch a film, it seems to be that you are inside it, and you are a character in it. 	B
2653	your company has carried out a full investigation on the matter and it appears that the disappearance was not the result of criminal activity. 	B
2654	It appears that there was an error with the older computer system. 	B
2655	If one doesn't live close enough to walk to work, one can choose to get there by bicycle or by car. 	B
2656	It was considered to be the most important thing to supply every computer with Internet and E-mail access 	C
2657	It is hoped that this report will help the club to improve and meet the needs of the whole school. 	C
2658	Firstly it was highlighted that so many people take advantage of the park, but our survey clearly contradicts this view. 	C
2659	It was my father who took all this away from me. 	C
2660	This is a very interesting place. 	A
2661	I'm very happy about this. 	A
2662	This is my number: 0754 567 78 51. 	A
2663	This is the information about the new art class: the class is on Fridays, and it starts at 4 pm and finishes at 6 pm. 	A
2664	Thank you for this. 	A
2665	I went shopping yesterday at Yalerias;. I bought three green T-shirts, a pair of sneakers and some socks. You might ask, why did I buy all this? 	A
2666	This is the best holiday I have ever had! 	A
2667	This is just a short note to ask you if you want to go with me to the ReggaRton's concert. 	A
2668	That was amazing. 	A
2669	After that, we can go and drink a cup of coffee and eat a piece of cake. 	A
2670	You know that blue is my favourite colour, so we are going to use that. 	A
2671	It has got a camera, and I like that. 	A
2672	They look really nice on me, that's why I bought them. 	A
2673	Please try to come after 4.30 because I won't be there before that. 	A
2674	That's great! 	A
2675	That's a pity! 	A
2676	That's a good idea! 	A
2677	That's all for now. 	A
2678	Well I think that's all. 	A
2679	To stay fit I'm eating lots of fruit and vegetables, but meat and fish, too. I think you should do this, too, if you haven't done it in the past. 	B
2680	People usually don't care about the cost. Because of this, weddings are more amazing. 	B
2681	My room seems to be very cold and very unfriendly. I think flowers and pictures change this. 	B
2682	Our department currently has a lot of work to do, because there are so many conferences to arrange, and it needs a person to be in charge of this. 	B
2683	These are the most important years for us as teenagers, and they have to be the best years! 	B
2684	These are the main things that I can tell you. 	B

2988	Don't you like any programmes? 	B
2989	Don't you think she would be happy? 	B
2990	Don't you know me? 	B
2991	Haven't you seen it yet? 	B
2992	Haven't they got their own style? 	B
2993	Wouldn't you like to come? 	B
2994	I'm going to a picnic next Saturday with my parents, won't you come with us? 	B
2995	Can't you make both? 	B
2996	Finally two days ago I found it in my pocket! It's funny! Don't you think? 	B
2997	They're filming a part of Harry Potter at our school, because our main building is very old. Isn't that great? 	B
2998	You can even just relax and sunbathe while you drink a nice, cold lemonade. Wouldn't that be amazing? 	B
2999	While we were there, there was also a concert and I got to see Rihanna and Chris Brown! Isn't that awesome? 	B
3000	Do we not want our children to be as happy as possible? 	C
3001	Is it not too easy to put the blame systematically on our education? 	C
3002	Is it not possible to have this, though maybe on a smaller scale, in our everyday living right where we spend the majority of our time on earth? 	C
3003	Are they not aware of the negative effects the use of cars has on cities? 	C
3004	Can it not, sometimes, be harmful to the world? 	C
3005	I'm looking forward to seeing you! 	A
3006	I look forward to hearing from you. 	A
3007	I am looking forward to our meeting. 	A
3008	I could catch up with the work I miss after school from 3 to 4. 	B
3009	They interviewed and filmed pupils and teachers to find out how they get on with each other. 	B
3010	I'd better stop now and get on with my studying. 	B
3011	I think that if you want to have a peaceful holiday, you should get away from the city and enjoy the countryside, enjoy nature. 	B
3012	So you had better go walking or join a club, but don't forget to keep away from junk food. 	B
3013	I can look up to someone in admiration if he 	B
3014	Other people will see you as a knowledgeable person and they will look up to you. 	B
3015	You should face up to the problem and tell everybody the truth, that you are working too hard. 	B
3016	We couldn't just swim and eat ice-cream every day of our summer vacation, so we sat down and came up with the craziest idea ever. 	B
3017	Anyway, let me tell you what ideas I came up with. 	C
3018	Sometimes in order to feel confident and to be inspired we need a person to look up to. 	C
3019	This you will have to look out for. 	C
3020	This shows her superficiality, which Kingshaw cannot put up with. 	C
3021	Firstly, let me express that the situation you describe is certainly not something my client could easily put up with. 	C
3022	It is widely accepted that being a loyal and trusted individual means that the people around us can trust us or let us in on a secret. 	C
3023	I listen to music in the living room, and also eat my breakfast, lunch and dinner. 	A
3024	I can look after her if she needs to do shopping and cleaning. 	A
3025	I like to walk in the woods and look for mushrooms. 	A
3026	If you need more information, please look at the information sheet at the entrance. 	B
3027	In fact, our company needs to train some staff on how to deal with the complaints of customers. 	B
3028	In Poland rules that refer to how to dress at school aren't very strict; we don't wear any uniforms, but our clothes have to be clean and nice to look at. 	B
3029	But there is one difficulty which we should deal with. 	B
3030	I would like to give you some ideas of what people in my community want to listen to. 	B
3031	I am really willing to know more about horses and to learn how to deal properly with them. 	B
3032	I hope you will look carefully at the enclosed papers and I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon. 	B
3033	I hope that you'll come. 	A
3034	I think that it begins on 20 or 21 May. 	A
3035	My mother said that she can help us. 	A
3036	I heard that you are quite busy right now. 	A
3037	I hope you can go, buddy. 	A
3038	I think I left my phone there, maybe in your kitchen. 	A
3039	I think you should go visit the Kuala Lumpur Twin Towers. 	A
3040	I know it's impossible for you to come during examination time. 	A
3041	My mother said you can come to me at 6.30 pm. 	A
3042	I told you that she has a new car? 	A
3043	You promised me that you will help me to paint my bedroom. 	A
3044	Nisha told me you had an accident last week. 	A
3045	Now you're sixteen, I totally understand that you don't want to go on holiday with your parents. 	B
3046	When I got there, I realised that I wasn't the only winner. 	B
3047	I think also that you should say to your parents that you want to try a new experience with your friends. 	B
3048	 When I said to my friends that I had met with him, they didn't believe me. 	B
3049	I'm going to get up early on Saturday. 	A
3050	Shall we go out this weekend to a concert? 	A
3051	We can meet up at 2 pm. 	A
3052	If you have time, you can come over and I will introduce you to my friends. 	A
3053	Every day I can see the sea when I wake up. 	A
3054	I will pick you up and arrange everything. 	A
3055	Ring me up or send me an email if you have any questions. 	A
3056	You may need to throw it away, it'll be too dirty after painting. 	A
3057	Could you come here by nine o'clock to help me out? 	A
3058	I needed to hang out because my life was too jam-packed and hectic. 	B
3059	 Its battery had run out. 	B
3060	She cried a lot. Her feelings, emotions were all scattered. But Lisa didn't give up. 	B
3061	Were it not for my university, I would give up this class immediately. 	B
3062	I must travel to Mexico City because I won a novel contest and I need to pick up my award. 	B
3063	So I opened the envelope and took out the letter. 	B
3064	She turned off the phone and walked to the bathroom. 	B
3065	I heard about this club when I was watching T.V. and I wanted to check it out. 	B
3066	I really like shopping for clothes, but I hate trying them on because always when I finish, the shop assistant shows me more clothes. 	B
3067	So, think it over and tell me what you decide to do. 	B
3068	Some species are dying out, and keeping such animals in zoos where they can give life to new generations is the only way to prevent them from becoming completely extinct. 	B
3069	The following day my grandpa didn?t show up. 	B
3070	If you are not good enough at reading, you'll end up wasting your time. 	B
3071	I don't need to use my imagination while I'm surfing the internet, but if I'm reading a book I can build up the whole surroundings and the characters in my own head. 	B
3072	I had already booked my seat on the ferry-boat to Athens and I couldn't put off my crossing. 	B
3073	I can surf the internet and look up some useful information. 	B
3074	The concert finished very late and after the concert I had to clean up the hall. 	B
3075	I am glad that you have decided to take some time off and more glad because you are going to the U.S. 	B
3076	Another way is also to turn the computers off in the evenings. 	B
3077	It was necessary to call the electrician up. 	B
3078	If we can make these improvements, we might be able to work this problem out. 	B
3079	 I went to check them out last week and here is my review of the two concerts. 	C
3080	 I tried to clean it up as much as possible. 	C
3081	 We just need a small set and a little time to fix it up. 	C
3082	You know, I love your cooking! 	A
3083	I have very good friends. 	A
3084	She comes from India. 	A
3085	She has long, dark hair and brown eyes. 	A
3086	He gets up at 6 o'clock and goes to work. 	A
3087	I heard from our neighbours about you. 	A
3088	My grandmother lived in a village and I often went there. 	A
3089	I am 22 years old. 	A
3090	There are 4 rooms. 	A
3091	And I like my home because it's not too big and it's a very nice flat. 	A
3092	It was very nice. 	A
3093	I am writing to tell you what I do every day at college. 	A
3094	I'm working today. 	A
3095	We are going to the park. 	A
3096	Can you bring some music with you to the dinner. 	A
3097	I'll be very happy to help you. 	A
3098	I would like to eat some Spanish food. 	A
3099	It has been a long time since I saw you. 	A
3100	I have left my suitcase in your house. 	A
3101	Have you got a mobile phone? 	A
3102	I haven't emailed you in a long time. 	A
3103	 Yes, I do. I am really excited about the idea. 	A
3104	Do you like shopping? 	A
3105	Did you buy a new mobile phone? 	A
3106	I thought that I wouldn't find nice clothes for me, but surprisingly, I did. 	A
3107	Why didn't you come to my birthday party? 	A
3108	It makes me feel comfortable and the room looks bigger with the colour. 	A
3109	My bedroom will be blue because the colour blue always looks fresh and I like it if it's always fresh. 	A
3110	And I think we should go somewhere else to have a drink after the film. 	A
3111	Please wear some of your old and torn clothes because they might get dirty. 	A
3112	You've got to bring paintbrushes, paper and paint, that's all. 	A
3113	You don't have to bring anything except your clothes. 	A
3114	But we used to play together every single day! 	B
3115	I think you ought to join a gym and you should go for a walk at least three times a week. 	B
3116	You needn't worry about where we can stay. 	B
3117	I think that they are rather jealous because they daren't give up their car. 	B
3118	I like to go to the zoo. 	A
3119	Sometimes I don't like to go out because It's very cold. 	A
3120	I want to invite you for dinner. 	A
3121	I like to work with my teacher. 	A
3122	I don't like to eat at College. 	A
3123	I like reading lots of magazines. 	A
3124	I don't like doing homework in college. 	A
3125	I like learning grammar. 	A
3126	I like travelling by car. 	A
3127	I would like to meet you to give you some information about the Brannl State and the shops near her. 	A
3128	I'd like to invite you on Sunday about six o'clock in the evening. 	A
3129	I bought them because I hope to go to England this year and the weather isn't very good. 	A
3130	Please remember to bring your pyjamas and your tooth brush. 	A
3131	Don't forget to come. 	A
3132	I love to play football. 	A
3133	I love to cook. 	A
3134	I prefer to play football but I often go to the gym. 	A
3135	I hate to watch any sports. 	A
3136	I love cooking and also baking. 	A
3137	I love listening to music, especially hip-hop music. 	A
3138	I hate wearing trousers in summer. 	A
3139	I'd love to do the concert. 	A
3140	I'd love to hear it! 	A
3141	We enjoy playing the piano and singing together. 	A
3142	You know I really enjoy listening to music. 	A
3143	? it's one of the reasons I decided to change class. 	B
3144	I'm going to buy pictures to hang on the wall, because my room seems to be very cold and very unfriendly. 	B
3145	I would prefer to pay by cash. 	B
3146	I would prefer to meet you at six o'clock instead of four, at the café in my hometown. 	B
3147	I'd prefer to go on holiday with my friends. 	B
3148	I would like to stay there a few years to finish studying and to have my own money to start thinking of travelling. 	B
3149	So, would you mind telling Mr and Mrs Thomas. 	B
3150	I wanted to help him to make some friends. He's just like me. 	B
3151	I hope that it will help you to keep fit. 	B
3152	I hope my advice can help you choose where to go. 	B
3153	This house is terrible and I hope you can help me find something better. 	B
3154	I would like you to come to a picnic on Saturday. 	B
3155	I would like you to come to my office on 16th of May to discuss the terms of the contract. 	B
3156	Your parents want you to go on holiday with them this summer. 	B
3157	You asked me to tell you about one of my friends. 	B
3158	Let me know if it is suitable for you. 	B
3159	She makes me smile when I'm sad. 	B
3160	She always makes me laugh! 	B
3161	You are eighteen now, you can do what you want and they should let you do it. 	B
3162	I think you should talk with your parents and try to make them understand how you feel and what you prefer. 	B
3163	Maybe your parents are afraid of letting you go away by yourself, they still consider you their baby. 	B
3164	 ... we can't avoid using them because we are used to them. 	B
3165	I couldn't stand being there. 	B
3166	Moreover we may consider offering bonus schemes, to increase the staff's loyalty to our company. 	B
3167	If your boss doesn't mind you delaying, it could be a possible solution. 	B
3168	I could not stand people shouting at me, or taking pictures of me all day. It would be horrible. 	B
3169	Oh just one more thing: would you mind me staying in your flat again? 	B
3170	We imagine it being a frozen land, where the people are ?frozen? too - both 'inside' and 'outside'. 	B
3171	He said if you need to change the time, remember to contact him to make a new appointment. 	B
3172	I know it is difficult to get by with such a low salary but I am sure you have not stopped to think twice about your life. 	B
3173	I remember feeling very unhappy and confused all day long. 	B
3174	After I had a baby, I needed to stop working. 	B
3175	"Then I heard someone screaming, I was afraid and I said to the others: ""Let's go out, something is happening"". "	B
3176	I think we can learn nothing by seeing animals out of their habitat: we cannot see them running or eating or hunting. 	B
3177	I would like to see it develop without any pollution and without destroying the environment. 	C
3178	Nowadays, it is very common in Argentina to hear people talk about the economic depression. 	C
3179	We in the student committee would hate to see all that space go to waste. 	C
3180	I am very much aware of my parents? mistakes and would hate to make the same ones. 	C
3181	My home is nice, there is a nice garden. 	A
3182	In my College there is a big library. 	A
3183	In my home there are two bedrooms, there's a kitchen, there's a bathroom and a living-room. 	A
3184	There are two bathrooms. 	A
3185	There are many shops and schools. 	A
3186	I think, in the park there are animals. 	A
3187	I need it because there is some money in it which I have to pay to someone. 	A
3188	There is some information about the new art class. 	A
3189	There's a lot of people there. 	A
3190	There's a lot of clothes but they are very cheap. 	A
3191	You can go to the town centre because there are a lot of shops in the town centre. 	A
3192	It's a very interesting place because there are a lot of pictures. 	A
3193	There isn't any noise. 	B
3194	The spring is the best time because there aren't too many tourists. 	B
3195	"There wasn't any message on it, just a big word ""DIE"". "	B
3196	There weren't any people on the bus she took. 	B
3197	 There will be flying cars and buses, and big houses. 	B
3198	In the countryside there wouldn?t be so many people and there is nothing to do. 	B
3199	In the large school there might be a lot of people that you can meet. 	B
3200	I figured out that there had to be matches somewhere; Bob, who owned the cabin, had told me that it was well equipped. 	B
3201	In the library there needs to be school books and also other books and magazines. 	B
3202	There is going to be a theatre performance, a chess championship and last but not least, swimming races where the participants will win medals and a lot of prizes. 	B
3203	Because today is my birthday. 	A
3204	Martin is from Poland. 	A
3205	My house is very clean. 	A
3206	It looks good on you. 	A
3207	We will really become good pen-friends. 	A
3208	Make sure you wear something over your clothes so that they won't get dirty. 	A
3209	Because it sounds interesting. 	A
3210	I feel sorry for you. I hope you get better as soon as possible. 	A
3211	There are indeed many ways of doing this and it all seems very confusing. 	B
3212	The food is a little bit strange but tastes good. 	B
3213	Now the whole house appeared very unfamiliar to me. 	B
3214	Alice was so unhappy that she remained silent for a long time. 	B
3215	I am writing to inform you that there is some incorrect information which appears in The Student Tourist Guidebook you published last year. 	B
3216	It is 3 hours long, and if you want to pass it you will have to study very hard, it is very difficult. 	A
3217	If you buy a gift for me, please buy a book, because I love to read. 	A
3218	If you agree, we can go shopping after the film. 	A
3219	If you find it, call me. 	A
3220	If you want to come, just tell me. 	A
3221	If I have spare time I always read a book. 	A
3222	If you need to contact me, here is my number: 07938776341, so just call me. 	A
3223	If you need some help I'm here to organise the meeting or to make the invitations. 	A
3224	You can get to my house if you take the number 35 bus. 	A
3225	If you need more information, call me. 	A
3226	Bring some films if you want. 	A
3227	Call me if you like. 	A
3228	Please, come here wearing a white T-shirt and a skirt, or shorts if you prefer. 	A
3229	If you want I can help you with the music. 	A
3230	If you like, you could bring some drinks. 	A
3231	We can go by bus or if you prefer we can go in my car. 	A
3232	I talked to my parents and I think if you tell them your reasons, they will accept it. 	B
3233	I'm sure your parents will be happy if you go with them. 	B
3234	If you live in the countryside you will see beautiful nature. 	B
3235	I think that it would be very good if you start going to the gym or you start cycling. 	B
3236	I would be very glad if you come and visit us. 	B
3237	If you come to Brazil you can stay at my home. 	B
3238	Billy, if you are moving you should think a lot, first you have to go and see the two schools. 	B
3239	However, if you are looking for fun and excitement, I would go for the city. 	B
3240	But if you are going to live in a town you should choose the large school. 	B
3241	In addition, if you are going to travel, please choose your partner very carefully. 	B
3242	Maybe it would be more fun if you went with your friends. 	B
3243	If you went on holiday with your friends, where would you go? 	B
3244	But, if I was able to move, I would like to live near the coast, because I love the sea, I like sunbathing and swimming. 	B
3245	Well, if I were you I would go to a small school in the countryside because it's less complicated than going to a large school in a town. 	B
3246	If I were you, I would talk to everybody and tell them when are you free, and spend the summer with both friends and parents. 	B
3247	 If I were you, I would accept both of them. 	B
3248	I think I am going to pay by cash, unless you accept credit cards. 	B
3249	If I were you I'd go to work on foot, unless it's far away from your house. 	B
3250	But unless you do some sports activities you will gain a lot of weight. 	B
3251	If you wanted to do some outdoor activities, we could go fishing or even walking through the green fields. 	B
3252	If you arrived in town the day before, we could arrange accommodation for you at the nearest Hotel. 	B
3253	If they had not been there, I would have been very lonely. 	B
3254	If I hadn't gone to these horse-riding lessons, I wouldn't have lost my watch. 	B
3255	I realise that if I hadn't agreed with my parents to go to the concert I wouldn't have met Britney Spears. 	B
3256	Is the Sheraton Hotel ok for you? If not, call me as soon as possible. 	B
3257	Do you work on Sundays? If not, you could do exercise on Sundays. 	B
3258	I hope it's ok for you. If not, call me on my mobile phone. 	B
3259	Do you think we could have an extra class? If so, I'd like to do it to cover the work I'll miss. 	B
3260	Is it possible to pay by credit card? If so, which ones do you take? 	B
3261	As long as it involves children I'd be delighted to work for you during the summer. 	B
3262	If you're really eager to learn age doesn't really matter as long as you're willing to learn. 	B
3263	My client will most certainly ask for compensation covering all losses incurred, unless you manage to find out where the goods are. 	B
3264	Finally, I am pleased to inform you that we would like to offer a 10% discount provided you reserve office space for eighteen months. 	B
3265	Providing we implement the suggested actions I believe we can increase sales within the next six months, overcoming the current situation caused by the international situation. 	B
3266	I would suggest that you might bring a city map in case you lose your way. 	B
3267	All this could have been avoided, if the plan had been more flexible. 	C
3268	Several statements in the newspaper could have been avoided, if the writer had taken notice of the income results which were sent along with the other facts from the charity day. 	C
3269	However, I think I could have learned more if more individual tuition had been available. 	C
3270	I wrote this article referring to my own experience in London, hence I might have had a different opinion if I had gone to another city or country. 	C
3271	Furthermore I found little rooms where an employee could take a short nap if needed. 	C
3272	Meals are served, if requested, three times a day, unless picnic lunches are needed. 	C
3273	Women who want to start a career more often decide to be single or, if married, don't devote much time to the family. 	C
3274	If you should have any concerns about my choice, please tell me. 	C
3275	If you should have any problems, you can go to an information booth and you will be told which train you have to take to Hassau. 	C
3276	If you should get lost, don't hesitate to call us. 	C
3277	If you should have any further questions do not hesitate to contact us. 	C
3278	Should you require any further information about the program or any other detail please do not hesitate to ask for it. 	C
3279	Should there be a lack of mutual understanding a break-up is unavoidable. 	C
3280	Should we win your prize we would like to build a new school close to our production center, for the children of the area. 	C
3281	Should you fail to do so, we would have no choice but to take further action. 	C
3282	Had he been more experienced he would have known that these things always happen in this part of the world. 	C
3283	Had we known this fact we would have organised more activities within school hours. 	C
3284	Had we learnt from the mistakes of the past, we would have given up fighting each other a long time ago. 	C
3285	Had I known so many people from abroad were coming to visit our stand, I would have studied harder during my private lessons in the past. 	C
3286	Had this file fallen into enemy hands, it might have had disastrous effects on the Western world. 	C
3287	Had public transportation been an option I would have chosen that instead of my car. 	C
3288	Were I to win this travel scholarship, the country of my choice would be Japan. 	C
3289	Were you to compare people's views on animals to their views on food, you would find many similarities. 	C
3290	Were someone to decide that he did not want to go to university, he would have to face the consequences of his choice. 	C
3291	Were this suggestion to be put into practice, our town's personality would change completely from a small town to a port of call for a large number of visitors. 	C
3292	As a matter of fact, education is free and as a result they can attend whichever university they desire so long as they have the proper qualifications, of course. 	C
3293	I was allowed to bring my friends home and go out with them on condition that my parents knew where I was and when I was going to return. 	C
3294	Were it not for my university, I would give up this class immediately. 	B
3295	Were it not for that kind of toy, children would be able to gain more team-spirit, creativity and self-confidence. 	C
3296	In fact, were it not for that reason, Laura would have accepted the comfortable executive chair in a big company. 	C
3297	If it weren't for that boy, I am definitely certain that I would have failed the examinations and I would have ended up taking the class again the following year. 	C
3298	"If it weren't for his determination, he would have resigned when he first heard ""no"". "	C
3299	If it were to be published, the first issue would probably include a small introduction about the people who helped in the creation of the magazine. 	C
3300	However displacing such a number of commuters will need a lot of planning and a very good infrastructure if it were to succeed. 	C
3301	Whether or not the visitors should imitate local customs and behaviour is definitely a debatable issue.	C
3302	Whether or not it is better to educate boys and girls in separate schools has been a widely discussed issue in recent years. 	C
3303	Whether or not richer countries should help these poor nations is a very controversial issue, there are people on both sides of the argument who have very strong feelings. 	C
3304	However, it depends only on the children whether or not they'll go to a university and there are many factors to be considered before deciding on going. 	C
3305	I can't come to your wedding because, as you know, I live in England and on Thursday 18th July I'm going to take the FCE exam. 	A
3306	As you know, my parents are leaving home tomorrow night to go to Spain. 	A
3307	So, what do you think? 	A
3308	 I have got an appointment with my dentist.  So, I'm really sorry about that and I'm getting so sad. 	A
3309	I'll be free at 15.00. So, I'll be at your house at 15.30. 	A
3310	Firstly, we need a good expert to run the course.	B
3311	Secondly, good materials are needed. 	B
3312	Secondly, I know you like a healthy life so if you don't eat too much candy and unhealthy food, you can keep fit easily. And lastly, please believe in yourself, I know you can do it, and don't give up the exercise. 	B
3313	Finally, I would be grateful if you would arrange a car from this airport. 	B
3314	First of all, I must tell you that it always depends on how badly you want to do something. 	B
3315	On the one hand going to a large school is better for making friends, but on the other hand I think you can learn better in a small school. 	B
3316	My new teacher, on the contrary, understands us and I think she is skilful, because during the first lesson she organised a game. 	B
3317	Moreover the health of our staff and customers is essential. 	B
3318	In addition it is wonderful to see the prize that the winner gets at the end, sometimes it is money or a nice holiday. 	B
3319	Besides, you're 18 years old and you aren't a baby. 	B
3320	"What is more, you could go to ""Estadio Centerano"" to watch football matches and to Maroias to go horseriding. "	B
3321	Furthermore, I think that you should do some small exercises during your break, for example you could go running in the morning and evening. 	B
3322	You see, in the park, you can enjoy fresh air. 	B
3323	The thing is, if I could move I'd go to the countryside. 	B
3324	Unfortunately, they filmed only the building and the garden, not the students! 	B
3325	Actually, I do not have much time to watch television. 	B
3326	Surprisingly, the suitcase was Lucy's. 	B
3327	 But some countries celebrate on other dates too, like they have Chinese New Year according to their calendar.  Likewise, in Nepal New Year is celebrated on 1st of Baishak, which is the start of a new year according to the Nepalese calendar. 	B
3328	This group is expected to decrease considerably in the next fifty years. Similarly, the population of children are likely to drop to 11.5% in 2050. 	B
3329	When you read a letter from someone, you can imagine and almost feel the emotions of that someone. In the same way, when you read a book, you can feel the author's sensations, travel to distant places or participate in adventures only possible in your imagination. 	B
3330	To begin with, I want to ensure that you are going to have a great time with us. 	B
3331	For a start, we have lived with books for thousands of years while television is only half a century old. 	B
3332	In conclusion, if people in zoos look after the animals, it isn't cruel to keep an animal in zoo. 	B
3333	To sum up, I think that whether you use a car or a bicycle depends on several aspects: where you live, when you work, the weather, and also the kind of job you do. 	B
3334	In summary I would like to say that the majority of students is willing to help with cleaning, collecting the rubbish or even giving up their cars. 	B
3335	Thus, I would be very grateful if you would send me clear explanations of the following points: firstly, I would like you to specify what 'the normal price' is, and therefore what would be the cost of two nights. 	B
3336	Consequently, visiting zoos can help people learn about nature. 	B
3337	Hence, there is a great need to improve the situation of those animals so that their life would not become life imprisonment. 	B
3338	Therefore, we are likely to enter the market as a pioneer, which will have a lot of benefits. 	B
3339	As mentioned above, it might be possible to negotiate better contracts for your company. 	C
3340	I hope this brief note has convinced you to start this club. As mentioned earlier, I have already asked for information. 	C
3341	So as shown above, I recommend TELECARS to be our car services supplier because it offers all we need. 	B
3342	My mother said that she can take us there. 	A
3343	The teacher said that we have to bring a notebook, a pencil and a rubber. 	A
3344	 It's very important to me to have it with me because my brother is in the hospital and my father told me that he will call. 	A
3345	My sister told me that this film is very good. 	A
3346	Gill told me that you had an accident last week. 	A
3347	I immediately called her to see if everything was o.k. and she said that she had won the lottery and she wanted to give some of the money to me. 	B
3348	He said that she was in big trouble because the phone was a bomb. 	B
3349	They said that our school was the most suitable school for that movie. 	B
3350	He said that it was his phone and he had left it in a cafe. 	B
3351	He said that he was a nuclear scientist and we had met before. 	B
3352	Mary told me that she was dating John. 	B
3353	In the letter, he told me that he was coming to Madrid on the first of June and he asked me if I was free. 	B
3354	You asked me if I like shopping. 	B
3355	I am asking you if we can change the time of the meeting to 5.00 pm. 	B
3356	A very rich movie producer asked her if she wanted to be in a movie, he said she would get paid 500,000 dollars, she agreed. 	B
3357	I asked her if she wanted to go and have dinner together. 	B
3358	Renata, a really good friend of mine, told me she was in this club, but she left it some time ago; she asked me if I was interested in joining this amazing club. 	B
3359	I'm writing to ask whether you're free next Saturday or not. 	B
3360	I asked why she was here. 	B
3361	I phoned and asked what sports we could play in this club. 	B
3362	When we asked why they were filming our school, they said they were looking for a location where they could film some boys and girls leaving the school and so they filmed us! 	B
3363	He saw a guy sat there so he sat next to him and asked where the football players were. 	B
3364	They filmed it and interviewed a few pupils about what they think about the new swimming pool in the gym and I asked when it would be on TV. 	B
3365	I always had good times with her and was very impatient to read this letter: I wondered what she had written. 	B
3366	I really wondered who he was, but I was embrassed to look at him. 	B
3367	"He felt like a worm too and he said to me: ""I'm sorry I'm not a good friend"". "	B
3368	"Maria answered ""Yes!? "	B
3369	"He answered: ""Come with me"". "	B
3370	"Then I thought: ""I can't stay in prison"". "	B
3371	"He asked ""Are you Clarice?"" I answered yes and then he told me that he was my father. "	B
3372	"She asked me ""How about we join the club?"" "	B
3373	"She thought: ""Should I go to the police or should I go back?? "	B
3374	"I thought: ""Either I talk to her now or I won't be able to talk to her anytime!? "	B
3375	"?Excuse me Sir, but you forgot your mobile phone,"" she said. "	B
3376	I must take it to the police station, she thought. 	B
3377	Yes of course, she answered. 	B
3378	"?What have I done?"" I thought. "	B
3379	?What should I do?? she asked herself. 	B
3380	But where is everybody? Am I alone? I asked. 	B
3381	What's your name? he asked. 	B
3382	She asked me to come back as soon as possible because my father is seriously ill. 	B
3383	As the concert finished, I heard someone call my name, I turned and there were two men from security who asked me to go up on the stage. 	B
3384	Dad asked me to help him at work. 	B
3385	He told me to go outside the concert hall and wait for him to come. 	B
3386	I have caught a cold and my doctors told me to rest in bed for a few days. 	B
3387	They told me to stay in the car and watch them and try to remember their faces. 	B
3388	At the airport they told him to come the next morning. 	B
3389	The trainer was impressed and said that if I play next time as well as this time, I'll be the 'pointing guard' in the team. 	B
3390	The letter said that he is coming home next month. 	B
3391	Her husband told me that the following day they would return to Germany so that was the last time I saw Sara. 	B
3392	"No problem, I thought, ""there is only one person"". "	B
3393	"We have come together, this man said, ""to celebrate our annual meeting and to call our master's ghost tonight!? "	B
3394	"No problem, I thought, ""there is only one person"". "	B
3395	"Forgive me, sweetheart, he said, ""I will never leave you alone again.? "	B
3396	I was astonished when I saw them standing there, said John. 	B
3397	Who are you? asked Peter. 	B
3398	Would you mind lending me a part of your newspaper? said a whispering voice. 	B
3399	What do you think about this? said the Inspector to the policeman. 	B
3400	So this is a real cow, mom? she asked doubtfully. 	B
3401	A hundred dollars for one day. Is that a deal? her husband said forcefully. 	B
3402	Come on, what's wrong? Bella asked curiously. 	B
3403	Put that light out! I shouted calmly. 	B
3404	Meanwhile, she told me not to be scared but the place was very... old. 	B
3405	I told him not to climb the wall but he was so interested in doing movements that he did not listen to me. 	B
3406	Arriving there, my father told me not to go far and to stay near him. 	B
3407	I asked Pat not to tell anyone, and she promised me she wouldn't. 	B
3408	First of all, your advertisement says that you have got two great nights in a hotel for us. 	B
3409	It says you are asking for people to help in a summer camp for foreign school children. 	B
3410	Firstly, your advertisement  tells  us that hotel has two great nights in a wonderful 3-star hotel 	B
3411	The guidebook says that we can get there by train from London. 	B
3412	I was wondering why I failed. 	B
3413	So, he was wondering why we didn't have our letters. 	B
3414	"I was thinking which of the two would be more interesting, and I prefer to go to ""Can Animals Speak"", since I love them and I have two. So, I want to know how to communicate with them. "	B
3415	We were wondering what had happened for a few minutes but then we realised that there had been a power cut. 	B
3416	While he was thinking how to reply, Jenny took his hand and led him to the school. 	B
3417	She had told me the previous day that she had something important to tell me. 	B
3418	We met Daisy at school on the following day and we told her that the previous day we had been at her house; her grandfather had told us that unluckily she wasn't at home. 	B
3419	My boss had told me the previous day that an important customer was going to visit the company in the morning. 	B
3420	I had told my friends the day before that I expected to get an A! 	B
3421	In the morning, I go to the beach. 	A
3422	In my country, the most popular food is Paella, which is a kind of rice with seafood, really tasty. 	A
3423	From your house, take the first turning on your left after the roundabout. 	A
3424	That's my diary, the dearest thing I had. Here I wrote how I felt, what I did, who I met and all my problems. 	B
3425	Quickly I opened the envelope, took out a white piece of paper and started to read. 	B
3426	Suddenly, the door opened. 	B
3427	Outside, it wasn't a sunny day any longer, it was raining a lot. 	B
3428	It's great that you have got a new job! 	B
3429	It's true that there are one or two programmes that are interesting or funny, but the rest... they're horrible! 	B
3430	It's important that you are happy. 	B
3431	It is really sad that you have to move to a different area. 	B
3432	The reason I am writing is to suggest a few things about our holidays. 	B
3433	The reason that I never continued taking lessons is that my school-work became too heavy and the costs of lessons were too expensive for me as a student. 	B
3434	"The place you need is called ""Academiuta"". "	B
3435	The place we appreciated the most was the Cap Frehel, where nature is still wild and the birds feel at home. 	B
3436	The place which has impressed me most of all in my life is Abastumani. 	B
3437	The reason is I like children, I have experience of looking after disabled people and I like to do things like volunteering. 	B
3438	The problem is I know myself, I am always late when I have to leave my house so I need a car to go faster. 	B
3439	The fact is that not all animals are able to deal with this. 	B
3440	The fact is science needs computers to increase knowledge and businesses need them like the air we breathe. 	B
3441	It is true that a lot of accidents are caused by cars. The point is that the car itself does not cause the accident. 	B
3442	The thing is, Alison is an eleven-year-old girl who has been, together with her father, left behind by her mother when she was just three. 	B
3443	At the end of the day everything is up to you! 	C
3444	All in all, the activity week was a nice experience for both students and teachers. 	C
3445	All things considered, I would recommend the third proposal as it seems to me that it covers most of the points the students have been complaining about. 	C
3446	When it comes down to it, who does not like such a surprise? 	C
3447	When you think about it, can we afford a flat in Central London and still have something left with a basic salary? 	C
3448	Note the disadvantages of this transfer. 	C
3449	Notice the difference in the salary. 	C
3450	See the written instructions on the phone for complete instruction. 	C
3451	What we need is a strong publicity campaign, directed at young people. 	C
3452	What everyone loved were the special effects and we were very impressed by the use of advanced technological innovations. 	C
3453	What companies care about is money and football players help them to earn it. 	C
3454	What tourists want is to see the most typical things in England, not a hamburger restaurant or a London musical from the back row in the gallery. 	C
3455	What students learn are mostly facts and theories. 	C
3456	What I found particularly fascinating about this story is that it is still exciting and thrilling, despite the plot being rather easy to follow. 	C
3457	People are sensitive, and when they hear about charities, they always want to help. 	C
3458	If you fund this event, you will gain in two ways: firstly you will help needy people, and secondly you will be admired. 	C
3459	How I investigated. First I started looking on the internet in general. 	C
3460	This drink will be taken by athletes of any kind. 	C
3461	Compared to other European capitals, there has been a lot done to make riding a bike less dangerous and more comfortable in Berlin. 	C
3462	Outlined below are some essential reasons which justify my choice and should be seriously considered. 	C
3463	Not a word was spoken by anyone throughout the journey. 	C
3464	Not a scrap of remorse do they have. 	C
3465	How we are brought up forms our character, our thinking and our attitude towards ourselves and towards everybody and everything around us. 	C
3466	Where he had gone to was a mystery. 	C
3467	How they influenced my life is hard to tell. 	C
3468	Why I think my father is successful is because of his personality, he is very fair about everything,; for example if he sees two beautiful women walking down the street and you ask him which is the nicest of them, he couldn't tell even if one was plain ugly he couldn't. 	C
3469	 How people have got their objects is also important. 	C
3470	"The sad thing about it was that it was actually Richard who said, ""Why don't you go on holiday?' "	C
3471	The strange thing was that the noise reminded her of someone making a cup of tea. 	C
3472	The sad fact is, poverty is very likely to pass down to the next generation in these situations. 	C
3473	The relevant point is that that personal, almost intimate relationship between the possessor and the thing possessed is at the core of that particular love we all hold for certain things. 	C
3474	The only problem is that they are a little too noisy in the night. 	C
3475	It is Lily who decides to go to the seaside and it is also her who kills the turkey given by a lorry-driver. 	C
3476	It was Paul who stole the money. 	C
3477	It is Piggy who finds the conch and knows how to blow it. 	C
3478	It is my mother who always plays the role of mediator. 	C
3479	It is this silence that gives me the impression of togetherness, for which no words are needed. 	C
3480	But all of a sudden, out of nowhere a bunch of people came running towards him, yelling something he couldn't understand. 	C
3481	All in all, taking everything into account, I would suggest that a leisure centre would be the most beneficial as it provides all the facilities necessary to attract and benefit a number of people in the community. 	C
3482	What is more, from my point of view happiness has nothing to do with big things but with small things such as day-to-day details. 	C
3483	My college is not very big. 	A
3484	I know you are not well. 	A
3485	I'm not a good swimmer. 	A
3486	This place isn't big. 	A
3487	I don't have a dining room, so we eat in the living room. 	A
3488	We don't like other lessons, for example: French language. 	A
3489	In winter, we can't go visiting because it is too cold. 	A
3490	I can't find my CD. 	A
3491	The gas is not working. 	A
3492	The window is broken and is not closing. 	A
3493	Now, I haven't got any money, but I am really happy! 	A
3494	I haven't tidied my room since I bought this mobile. 	A
3495	We have not got hot water so the water is very cold. 	A
3496	It was very sad that you didn't come to my birthday party but it's ok. 	A
3497	I didn't spend a lot of money: only £143. 	A
3498	Don't forget your electric guitar. 	A
3499	Don't be late. 	A
3500	I'm sorry I can't come to your wedding because I am very sick. 	A
3501	Sorry but I won't be in town on Wednesday 17th. 	A
3502	You shouldn't wear formal clothes. 	A
3503	I bought a shirt, because I haven't got any. 	A
3504	As regards close friends, I don't have many. 	B
3505	Come at 5.00 pm. Don't bring anything. 	A
3506	I bought these clothes because I need them for my new job, but now I have no money because they cost £250. 	A
3507	I had no clothes to wear at John's party, so I went shopping yesterday. 	A
3508	I bought them because I didn't have any shirts or hats. 	A
3509	I have only spent £25 because I haven't much money. 	A
3510	I'm in Bilbao, and here I haven't got many things to do. 	A
3511	It was raining for seventy two hours and it wasn't going to stop. 	B
3512	I hadn't expected to receive a letter from her. 	B
3513	But I don't think it'll help you. 	B
3514	I don't think I'll live here forever because I intend to move to Curitiba, a southern city of my country. 	B
3515	I don't believe that the suitcase will be returned to me. 	B
3516	Can't you go with your parents some time and with your friends later? 	B
3517	Don't you think it's fun? 	B
3518	Aren't you excited about it? 	B
3519	You're free on Saturday , aren't you? 	B
3520	I think it would be fantastic, wouldn't it? 	B
3521	Isn't it marvellous? 	B
3522	Don't you think it's fantastic? 	B
3523	You love books, don't you? 	B
3524	I said I had nothing, but he didn't believe me. 	B
3525	I haven't seen anything yet. 	B
3526	I didn't tell anyone about this story at first. 	B
3527	Nobody will ever know who that man was. 	B
3528	I stayed there for two weeks and it never rained. 	B
3529	I haven't decided yet. 	B
3530	But I still don't believe her. 	B
3531	But every time a small envelope arrived, I ripped it open as fast as I could. Not this time. 	B
3532	I would like to apologise for not being able to attend on Friday 13th June for my visit. 	B
3533	The picnic will be held in the park three kilometres away from the city center so it will be quiet and not crowded. 	B
3534	Well, I think it will be better for you to go to a large school in the centre of the town and not to the small school. 	B
3535	Do not take on too many assignments at a time. 	B
3536	I cannot agree with you Mr Brown. 	B
3537	Keeping them in zoos will not help them. 	B
3538	Never have I seen such a realistic and impressive film before. 	B
3539	Never had I thought that my parents would do this to me. 	B
3540	Neither you nor I would like that. 	B
3541	We can neither eat nor drink during the lessons. 	B
3542	I have neither climbed nor surfed before, so that would be very exciting for me. 	B
3543	Neither of us is liable in this case. 	B
3544	Moreover, none of my friends are interested therefore there is no one I can talk to. 	B
3545	We even met a French group and as none of them spoke English, we stayed with them to translate what they were asked. 	B
3546	In fact, there are none, but the hills that do exist can be dubbed mountains - just because there are none... 	C
3547	Concerning your question about any special requirements of some students - I am glad that I am able to tell you that there are none this year. 	C
3548	Problems when using English? None. 	C
3549	Not everyone likes sports or music. 	C
3550	Not everything was as good as we expected. 	C
3551	Not all students, though, can attend the centre as it is not always open, and their lessons finish at 5 pm, the closing time of the centre. 	C
3552	Not all of us have got the fighting spirit to visit the gym regularly, but many of us would like to have a healthy look. 	C
3553	Not every cyclist is a danger to the public as most of them obey all rules and respect other road users. 	C
3554	Not only was it in a wonderful location, with extraordinary views, but it was also very accessible and the shops were really near. 	C
3555	Not only do they have the biggest turnover overall, they also managed to increase it constantly from 2000 to 2002. 	C
3556	This is not necessarily the way the older generation would see it, though. 	C
3557	Being a passionate student of the English language, you do not necessarily need a teacher to guide you through the meanders of English. 	C
3558	I'm not sure what exactly they would expect us to do at the campsite, but organising the entertainment is not really my thing. 	C
3559	Personally, I do not actually think that this relationship will change. 	C
3560	They were sent to Britain to improve their English but few had any real contact with the language. 	C
3561	English is the most spoken language nowadays and although most of the people can speak a bit of English, very few speak it in the right way. 	C
3562	The Greeks have always been a tortured folk; everyone tried to conquer them, but few managed. 	C
3563	This means that nothing shall change for the employees, there shall be no implication whatsoever for their rights stipulated in their employment contracts. 	C
3564	Organising the entertainment would be rather fun, whilst waiting tables would be boring and we have no experience whatsoever. 	C
